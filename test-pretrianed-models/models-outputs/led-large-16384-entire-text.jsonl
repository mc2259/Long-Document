And to make this quite clear I say that I consider those who are able to support themselves by their own resources who can, either by abundance of men or money, raise a sufficient army to join battle against any one who comes to attack them; and I consider those always to have need of others who cannot show themselves against the enemy in the field, but are forced to defend themselves by sheltering behind walls.

And beyond this, to keep the people quiet and without loss to the state, they always have the means of giving work to the community in those labours that are the life and strength of the city, and on the pursuit of which the people are supported; they also hold military exercises in repute, and moreover have many ordinances to uphold them.Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that the affairs of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an army a whole"}

{"references": ["\"On Cruelty and Clemency: Whether It Is Better To Be Loved or Feared,\" posits the seemingly simple argument that, though it is ideally better to be merciful than cruel, clemency should be handled in moderation.\nAgain, Machiavelli complicates the notion of good as purely subordinate to power, invoking utilitarian reasoning to argue that an excess of \"good\" can actually lead to harm. this case, too much clemency can lead to uprisings and civil war.\nMachiavelli cites the example of Florence, which was afraid to intervene with the required force in Pistoia and was in turn destroyed through civil conflict.\nIf a prince needs to be cruel to keep his subjects united and loyal, so be it.\nCruelty can serve the greater good.\nThere are two ways of fighting, Machiavelli asserts in the following chapter, \"The Way Princes Should Keep Their Word\": with laws, and with force.\nThe first is the human method, and the second belongs in theory to the beasts.\nThat said, there are times when the first method does not suffice, in which case a prince needs to rely on force.\nTherefore, a prince should study the art of both laws and war, the methods of both man and beasts.\nWhen it comes to beasts, two models exist: the lion, which represents brute force and strength, and the fox, which represents wiliness.\nA prince needs both, for one without the other will lead only to ruin.\nMachiavelli, as might be expected, proceeds to focus on the fox: \"a prudent prince cannot and should not keep his word when to do so would go against his interest.\nTo be crafty and to be able to deceive, the mythical hallmarks of the fox, are key skills for any ruler.\nYou can break promises and treaties as long as you can hide your duplicity; you must therefore be \"a great liar and hypocrite.\nA prince need not possess all the virtues listed in Chapter XV.\nHe need not be giving, merciful, faithful, spirited, humane, chaste, straightforward, gentle, but he needs to seem to possess these virtues.\nAdmittedly, it is good to follow virtues both in appearance and in reality, but a prince must be able to switch to the contrary at a moment's notice if necessary, while maintaining a consistent front", "So generosity was a no-go.\nAnd compassion? Well, you guessed it: compassion isn't really conducive to the sort of warlike ruler Machiavelli advocates and might actually destroy a nation.\nJust like it's better to be a little mean than nice for the sake of the nation, it's better to be feared than loved because people seem to react better to punishment than love.\nAgain, Machiavelli keeps telling us not to become hated, which is easy enough if you lay off people's families and lands.\nIn Machiavelli's example section, he tells us how Hannibal was super awesome because he was insanely cruel.\nWe mean, there's a reason why that scary dude from Silence of the Lambs was named Hannibal.\nGuess who almost wasn't awesome?\nThis guy called Scipio who was all mushy touchy feely and didn't want to punish people.\nLucky for him, other people covered up his namby-pamby nature.\nBut everyone is not so lucky.\nAnyway, in the end, since the people choose if they like you or not, don't worry about it.\nJust make sure that they don't hate you.", "Every prince will want to be considered merciful, but mercy should not be mismanaged.\nCesare Borgia, by being cruel, restored peace and order to the Romagna.\nNo prince should mind being called cruel for keeping his subjects peaceful and loyal.\nPunishing a few, and thus averting disorder, is better than allowing troubles to develop that will hurt many.\nNew rulers cannot avoid seeming cruel, because their states are insecure.\nStill, a prince should not be too rash or too fearful.\nIf you cannot be both loved and feared, then it is better to be feared than loved.\nMen are generally fickle, afraid of danger, and greedy.\nWhen a prince benefits them, they will do anything for the prince, but when trouble comes, they will desert the prince.\nPeople will break ties of love if it is to their advantage, but fear of punishment they will never transgress.\nA prince must be careful not to make himself hated, even though he is feared; to do this, he must keep his hands off his subjects' property and their women.\nPeople will sooner forget the death of a father than the loss of an inheritance.\nHowever, when a prince commands an army, he must be cruel in order to control his troops.\nIn conclusion, people love at their own wish, but fear at the prince's will, so a wise ruler will rely on what he can best control.", "Concerning Cruelty: Whether It Is Better to Be Loved Than to Be Feared, or the Reverse  Compassion, like generosity, is usually admired.\nBut a prince must be careful that he does not show compassion unwisely.\nIf a prince is too compassionate, and does not adequately punish disloyal subjects, he creates an atmosphere of disorder, since his subjects take the liberty to do what they please--even to the extremes of murder and theft.\nCrime harms the entire community, whereas executions harm only the individuals who commit crimes.\nSome measure of cruelty is necessary to maintain order.\nBut a prince should be careful in his exercise of cruelty, tempering it with humanity and prudence.\nMachiavelli then asks whether being feared or loved is preferable.\nIdeally, a prince should be both loved and feared, but this state of affairs is difficult to attain.\nForced to make a choice, it is much better to be feared than loved.\nThis is because men, by nature, are \"ungrateful, fickle, dissembling, anxious to flee danger, and covetous of gain.\nIn times of remote danger, they are willing to take risks for their prince, but if the danger is real, they turn against their prince.\nIt is easy to break a bond of love when the situation arises, but the fear of punishment is always effective, regardless of the situation.\nWhen inducing fear, however, a prince must be careful to avoid inducing hatred.\nHe must make sure that any executions are properly justified.\nAbove all, a prince should never confiscate the property of his subjects or take their women, since these actions are most likely to breed hatred.\nIf a prince must confiscate property, he must make sure he has a convincing reason.\nWith one's army, however, there is no such thing as too much cruelty.\nKeeping an army disciplined and united requires cruelty, even inhuman cruelty."], "prediction": "Coming..........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................\"...................................................................."}

Okay, okay.\nSome critics in the back of the room are pointing out that the Roman emperors followed this advice and still failed.\nFirst of all, that's like comparing apples to oranges.\nThey needed to deal with the greed and cruelty of the army in addition to not being hated.\nThis was a tough task, because the people wanted a peaceful leader, but the soldiers wanted the craziest, most bloodthirsty guy they could find.\nSince it was kind of impossible to please both sides, it was most important to", "A prince must avoid becoming hated or despised.\nTaking the property or the women of his subjects will make him hated.\nBeing frivolous, indecisive, and effeminate will make him despised.\nAll a prince's actions should show seriousness, strength, and decisiveness.\nThe best defense against internal threats such as conspiracy is to be neither hated nor despised.\nIf a conspirator thinks that killing the prince will enrage the people, he will think twice.\nWise princes are careful not to antagonize the nobles and to keep the people happy.\nIn France, the parliament restrains the ambition of the nobles and favors the people, without directly involving the king, so that he cannot be accused of favoritism.\nPrinces should let others do the unpleasant tasks, doing for themselves what will make them look good.\nSome people may object that the careers of the Roman emperors go against this argument, because many of them were greatly admired, yet were still assassinated.\nThis is because they had to deal with their soldiers, and they could not satisfy both the soldiers, who wanted warlike leaders, and the people, who wanted peace.\nMarcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were all compassionate and just, but only Marcus escaped assassination, because he was a hereditary ruler and did not owe his power to the army.\nCommodus, Severus, Antoninus, and Maximinus were all cruel and greedy, and only Severus escaped assassination, because he was so cunning and ruthless, and because he kept up a splendid reputation.\nBut in Machiavelli's time, princes do not have the same need to satisfy their armies, because armies are not used to being together for long periods and controlling whole provinces, the way Roman armies were.\nInstead, princes should satisfy the people, who are more powerful.", "The Need to Avoid Contempt and Hatred\nA prince must avoid being hated and despised at all costs.\nA prince may be criticized for a lack of virtue, but he will never be hated for it.\nHowever, a prince will be hated if he takes the property or women of his subjects.\nA prince must also avoid robbing his subjects of their honor.\nA prince will be despised if he has a reputation for being fickle, frivolous, effeminate, cowardly, or irresolute.\nIf a prince is regarded highly by his subjects, he will be shielded from conspiracies and open attacks.\nA prince should worry about two things: internal insurrection from his subjects and external threats from foreign powers.\nDefending against foreign enemies requires a strong army and good allies.\nA strong army always leads to good allies.\nA prince can defend against internal insurrection by making sure he is not hated or scorned by the people.\nThis is a powerful defense against conspiracies.\nA conspirator will have the courage to proceed with his conspiracy only if he believes the people will be satisfied when he kills the ruler.\nBut if the people would be outraged by the ruler's death, the conspirators will never have the gall to carry out the conspiracy.\nBy default, conspiracies are at a disadvantage.\nThey require the support of many people, each of whom faces severe punishment if the conspiracy is discovered.\nFurthermore, each of these people can profit richly by informing the prince about the conspiracy.\nA prince has on his side the entire government, his allies and the laws of the state.\nIf he secures the goodwill of the people, he seems invulnerable in the eyes of conspirators.\nWhenever possible, a prince should delegate the administration of unpopular laws to others and keep in his own power the distribution of favors.\nSometimes it will not be possible to avoid being hated by some members of the populace.\nIf it is not possible for the prince to avoid being hated, he must make it his first priority to escape the hatred of the most powerful parties.\nIn many instances, this will mean ensuring good standing within the ranks of the military.\nBut a prince should not worry too much about satisfying the demands of the troops, especially if it comes at the expense of the people.\nA number of later Roman emperors were overthrown due to excessive cruelty performed for the sake of their army.\nThe exception was Septimius Severus, who, emulating both"], "prediction": "ButBut.

Because the best fortress of all is the support of the people.\nMoreover, a prince should never rely entirely on fortresses and feel that they mean he need not worry about whether or not his people support him.\nThe next chapter, \"How a Prince Should Act to Acquire Reputation,\" presents Ferdinand of Spain as a key example.\nFer"], "prediction": "AndAnd so on. Therefore, as I have said, it is not a good thing for a prince to be a prince to be a prince, but it is not a good thing for a prince to be a prince to be a prince, but it is not a good thing for a prince to be a prince to be a prince. And a prince ought, above all things, always endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of his people, and not to be a prince to be a prince. This, I believe, arises firstly from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that the prince who relies entirely on fortune is lost when it comes to the issue of his people, and they are good or not according to the nature of their people. For this reason the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you. Therefore, the prince who is not able to defend himself, and who is not able to defend his people, will not be able to defend himself, and he will not be able to defend his people. Therefore, it would be better for a prince to be able to defend himself, than to be able to defend his people.And if those seigniors are considered who have lost their states in Italy in our times, such as the King of Naples, and are therefore his enemies, that is to say, when, without any reservation, he declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because if two of your powerful neighbours come to blows, they are of such a character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him or not. The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. In the absence of these defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field cannot be lost.I do not wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating.(*) Catherine Sforza, a daughter of Galeazzo Sforza and   "}

The king, however, having acquired Lombardy, regained at once the authority which Charles had lost: Genoa yielded; the Florentines became his friends; the Marquess of Mantua, the Duke of Ferrara, the Bentivogli, my lady of Forli, the Lords of Faenza, of Pesaro, of Piombino, the Lucchese, the Pisans, the Sienese--everybody made advances to him to become his friend.(*) Louis XII, King of France, \"The Father of the People,\"     born 1462, died 1515.Now I say that those dominions which, when acquired, are added to an ancient state by him who acquires them, are either of the same country and language, or they are not. When they are, it is easier to hold them, especially when they have not been accustomed to self-government; for men change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from bad to worse. Therefore, the Romans, foreseeing troubles, dealt with them at once, and, even to avoid a war, would not let them come to a head, for they knew that war is not to be avoided, but is only to be put off to the advantage of others; moreover they wished to fight with Philip and Antiochus in Greece so as not to have to arise in Italy; they could have avoided both, but this they did not wish; nor did that ever please them which is forever in the mouths of the wise ones of our time:--Let us enjoy the benefits of the time--but rather the benefits of their own valour and prudence, for time drives everything before it, and is able to bring with it good as well as evil, and evil as well as good.The Romans, in the countries which they annexed, observed closely these measures; they sent colonies and maintained friendly relations with(*) the minor powers, without increasing their strength; they kept down the greater, and did not allow any"}

Such barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords and hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed by a prince and his servants hold their prince in more consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear him any particular affection.The examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France. The entire monarchy of the Turk is governed by one lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the king take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease in holding it. The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others; but,"}

The Spartans held Athens and Thebes, establishing there an oligarchy; nevertheless they lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, Carthage, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them.But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not know how to govern themselves. For this reason they are very slow to take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them much more easily. Because such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot stand without his friendship and interest, and does it utmost to support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to freedom will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than in any other way. And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget.

when private citizens choose a ruler from their fellow citizens.\nMachiavelli declines to discuss the first method at length, because it speaks for itself.\nAgathocles was wicked, but through his great energy became a military commander in Syracuse.\nIn order to become ruler, he called the Senate and the leading citizens together for a meeting, and then massacred them.\nHis ability made him a

\"treacherous, pitiless, and irreligious.\nPrinces who commit criminal acts can achieve power, but never glory.\nKing Agathocles of Syracuse is an example of a man who rose to power through

prince comes to power by crime and wishes to be successful, he, like Agathocles, must only use cruelty in the first sense.\nTherefore, when a prince decides to seize a state, he must determine how much injury to inflict.\nHe needs to strike all at once and then refrain from further atrocities.\nIn this way, his subjects will eventually forget the violence and cruelty.\nGradually, resentment will fade, and the people will come to appreciate the resulting benefits of the prince's rule.\nMost important, a prince should be consistent in the way he treats his subjects"], "prediction":

never been able even in peaceful times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that of Agathocles if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigalia, as was stated above.Although a prince may rise from a private station in two ways, neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics.

Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance.But coming to the other point--where a leading citizen becomes the prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens--this may be called a civil principality.A principality is created either by the people or by the nobles, accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. But granted a prince who has established himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged--such a one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown that he has laid his foundations well.Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they only ask not to be oppressed by him. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has none around him, or few, who are not prepared to obey him. And so much the more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried once. It is to be added also that a prince can never secure himself against a hostile people, because of there being too many, whilst from the nobles he can secure himself, as they are few in number. The worst that a prince may expect from a hostile people is to be abandoned by them; but from hostile nobles he has not only to fear abandonment, but also that they will rise against him; for they, being in these affairs more far-seeing and astute, always come forward in time to save themselves, and to obtain favours from him whom they expect to prevail.Besides this, one cannot by fair dealing, and without injury to others, satisfy the nobles, but you can satisfy the people, for their object is more righteous than that of the nobles, the latter wishing to oppress"}

Therefore, if he who rules a principality cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not truly wise; and this insight is given to few.I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This duke entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete master of his own forces. And it has always been the opinion and judgment of wise men that nothing can be so uncertain or unstable as fame or power not founded on its own strength.I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good fortune, not having the valour which in adversity would defend it.

There is nothing more necessary to appear to have than this last quality, inasmuch as men judge generally more by the eye than by the hand, because it belongs to everybody to see you, to few to come in touch with you. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are not bound to observe it with them. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no longer.Every one admits how praiseworthy it is in a prince to keep faith, and to live with integrity and not with craft. Nevertheless our experience has been that those princes who have done great things have held good faith of little account, and have known how to circumvent the intellect of men by craft, and in the end have overcome those who have relied on their word. Of this endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ the fox has succeeded best. Therefore it is necessary for a prince to understand how to avail himself of the beast and the man. This has been figuratively taught to princes by ancient writers, who describe how Achilles and many other princes of old were given to the Centaur Chiron to nurse, who brought them up in his discipline; which means solely that, as they had for a teacher one who was half beast and half man, so it is necessary for a prince to know how"}

It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place of refuge from a first attack. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the more easily. This may have been well enough in those times when Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because the weakest party will always assist the outside forces and the other will not be able to resist. The Venetians, moved, as I believe, by the above reasons, fostered the Guelph and Ghibelline factions in their tributary cities; and although they never allowed them to come to bloodshed, yet they nursed these disputes amongst them, so that the citizens, distracted by their differences, should not unite against them. Which, as we saw, did not afterwards turn out as expected, because, after the rout at Vaila, one party at once took courage and seized the state.2. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from the people ought to leave them alone. For this reason the best possible fortress is--not to be hated by the people, because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you.3.

He was able with the money of the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since distinguished him.

Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest.The choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. And the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them faithful.

He married, first, Mary, daughter of    Charles the Bold; after her death, Bianca Sforza; and thus     became involved in Italian politics.

Hence it follows that those things he does one day he undoes the next, and no one ever understands what he wishes or intends to do, and no one can rely on his resolutions. But as in carrying them into effect they become revealed and known, they are at once obstructed by those men whom he has around him, and he, being pliant, is diverted from them. Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his own conclusions. With these councillors, separately and collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions.

The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you and from those you have crushed.

It is that a prince who conveys an impression of his wisdom is not so through his own ability, but through the good advisers that he has around him, but through the good advisers that he has around him, for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, unless they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of flatterers, of whom courts are full, because men are so self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into contempt. Therefore it must be inferred that good counsels, whencesoever they come, are born of the wisdom of the prince, and not the wisdom of the prince from good counsels. And they are not to be found otherwise, because men will always prove untrue to you unless they are kept honest by constraint.But if a prince who is not inexperienced should take counsel from more than one he will never get united counsels, nor will he know how to unite them. Each of the counsellors will think of his own interests, and the prince will not know how to control them or to see through them.A prince, therefore, ought always to take counsel, but only when he wishes and not when others wish; he ought rather to discourage every one from offering advice unless he asks it; but, however, he ought to be a constant inquirer, and afterwards a patient listener concerning the things of which he inquired; also, on learning that any one, on any consideration, has not told him the truth, he should let his anger be felt.There were none who knew Messer Antonio da Venafro as the servant of Pandolfo Petrucci, Prince of Siena, who would not consider Pandolfo to be a very clever man in having Venafro for his servant. Therefore, it follows necessarily that, if Pandolfo was not in the first rank, he was in the second, for whenever one has judgment to know good and bad when it is said and done, although he himself may not have the initiative, yet he can recognize the good and the bad in his servant, and the one he can praise and the other correct; thus the servant cannot hope to deceive him, and is kept honest. 1519, Emperor of the     Holy Roman Empire."}

The constant attention of Mr. Dashwood to his wishes, which proceeded not merely from interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him every degree of solid comfort which his age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the children added a relish to his existence.

Marianne had never seen her sister before.  She began almost to feel a dislike of her sister, and it was not so much as she had in the past.  She got up with a headache, was unable to talk, and was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment; giving pain every moment to her mother and sisters, by her sister, as every feeling must end with her, by carrying her thoughts to her sister.  But the feelings which made such composure a disgrace, left her in no danger of incurring it.  Her sensibility was potent enough!When breakfast was over she walked out by herself, and wandered about the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment and crying over the present loss.  She played over every favourite song that she had been used to play to Willoughby, every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at the instrument gazing on every line of music that he had written out for her, till her heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied.  She spent whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her voice often totally suspended by her tears.  In books too, as well as in music, she courted the misery which a contrast between the past and present was certain of giving.One morning, about a week after his leaving the country, Marianne was prevailed on to join her sisters in their usual walk, instead of wandering away by herself.  But there was one method so direct, so simple, and in her opinion so eligible of knowing the real state of the affair, that she could not help suggesting it to her mother.\"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,\" said she, \"whether she is or she is not engaged to Willoughby?  From you, her mother, and so kind, so indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence.  It would be the natural result of your affection for her.

She was perfectly convinced of it.  Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted.  He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste.  In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.  The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance.  They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood.

Inward melancholy it was impossible for a man like Oak, introspective far beyond his neighbours, to banish quite, whilst conning the present untoward page of his history.  He came up to the boundary fence, and stood to regain breath.

The blaze, enlarging in a double ratio by his approach and its own increase, showed him as he drew nearer the outlines of ricks beside it, lighted up to great distinctness.

The vast arch of cloud above was strangely low, and formed as it were the roof of a large dark cavern, gradually sinking in upon its floor; for the instinctive thought was that the snow lining the heavens and that encrusting the earth would soon unite into one mass without any intervening stratum of air at all.  From this chaotic skyful of crowding flakes the mead and moor momentarily received additional clothing, only to appear momentarily more naked thereby.

The high wall being that of a barrack, and marriage being looked upon with disfavour in the army, assignations and communications had probably been made across the river before to-night.

Boldwood seized it and opened it, expecting another anonymous one--so greatly are people's ideas of probability a mere sense that precedent will repeat itself.\"I don't think it is for you, sir,\" said the man, when he saw Boldwood's action.  \"Though there is no name, I think it is for your shepherd.\"\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac\u25ac"}

disapproved of Bathsheba's new piano and other new furnishings.\nHenery longed to be bailiff.\nHe felt God had cheated him.\nA religious discussion followed.\nOak arrived with some newborn lambs to be

{"references": ["Cut to a scene inside a church.\nA young man in a military jacket talks to a priest and goes up to the altar as if he's getting ready to be married.\nThe only problem is that there doesn't seem to be a bride anywhere around.\nEventually, the priest leaves.\nFinally, the young man turns and looks around the church.\nNot seeing anyone he knows, he walks out of the church and meets a young woman in a park.\nShe says she got the church mixed up and that she hopes they can be married the next day just as easily.\nThe dude is mad, though, and he says that he won't be ready to make another go at it for some time.\nThe woman ends the chapter by asking when the wedding will be.\nThe guy just says, \"God knows!\" and walks away from her.", "A small congregation at All Saints' Church was startled by the clash of spurs at the close of a weekday service.\nA cavalry soldier strode into the chapel and spoke to the curate. \"' Tis a wedding!\" murmured one of the women, brightening.\n\"Let's wait!\" Through the open door from the vestry they heard the creaking mechanism of the clock indicating half-past eleven.\nNo one appeared, and there was tittering and giggling.\nSo again at the three-quarter hour.\n\"I wonder where the woman is,\" a voice whispered.\nThis was repeated at the full hour.\nAs the angry sergeant was about to leave, Fanny arrived, breathless, to explain that she had been waiting at All Souls', which she had mistaken for All Saints'.\nShe suggested that they meet again the next day, but Troy refused to go through such a performance a second time.\nFanny, trembling, asked when the wedding would be. \"\n'Ah, when? God knows!' he said, with a light irony, and turning from her, walked rapidly away.\""], "prediction": "ALLAH.ALL SA...............................................The clock ticked on.  The women threw off their nervousness, and titters and giggling became more frequent.  They were about to disperse, when a smart footstep, entering the porch and coming up the central passage, arrested their attention.  The step echoed with a ring unusual in a church; it was the clink of spurs.  A young cavalry soldier in a red uniform, with the three chevrons of a sergeant upon his sleeve, strode up the aisle, with an embarrassment which was only the more marked by the intense vigour of his step, and by the determination upon his face to show none.  A slight flush had mounted his cheek by the time he had run the gauntlet between these women; but, passing on through the chancel arch, he never paused till he came close to the altar railing.  Here for a moment he stood alone.  There he stood, his face to the south-east, leaving behind him the clerk of the church, who had been standing on he porch, and who had been looking up at the soldier with his face to the south-east, and who had now turned his face to the clerk of the church, and who was now looking up at the sergeant.  The sergeant had not yet turned his face to the clerk of the church, and he had not yet turned his face to the clerk of the church, and he had not yet turned his face to the clerk of the church.The clergyman, who had not yet doffed his surplice, perceived the new-comer, and followed him to the communion-space.  He whispered to the soldier, and then beckoned to an elderly woman, apparently his wife, and they also went up the chancel steps.  Then came a dead silence.  The rattle of the quarter-jack again from its niche, its blows for three-quarters, its fussy retreat, were almost painfully abrupt, and caused many of the congregation to start palpably.

This place was his almonry and cloister in one: here, after looking to the feeding of his four-footed dependants, the celibate would walk and meditate of an evening till the moon's rays streamed in through the cobwebbed windows, or total darkness enveloped the scene.His square-framed perpendicularity showed more fully now than in the crowd and bustle of the market-house.  In this meditative walk his foot met the floor with heel and toe simultaneously, and his fine reddish-fleshed face was bent downwards just enough to render obscure the still mouth and the well-rounded though rather prominent and broad chin.  A few clear and thread-like horizontal lines were the only interruption to the otherwise smooth surface of his large forehead.  The wind, which had been blowing east for several weeks, had veered to the southward, and the middle of spring had come abruptly--almost without a beginning.

He had by this time grown used to being in love; the passion now startled him less even when it tortured him more, and he felt himself adequate to the situation.  In contemplating Bathsheba as a woman, he had forgotten the accidents of her position as an agriculturist--that being as much of a farmer, and as extensive a farmer, as himself, her probable whereabouts was out-of-doors at this time of the year.  The great aids to idealization in love were present here: occasional observation of her from a distance, and the absence of social intercourse with her--visual familiarity, oral strangeness.  The smaller human elements were kept out of sight; the pettinesses that enter so largely into all earthly living and doing were disguised by the accident of lover and loved-one not being on visiting terms; and there was hardly awakened a thought in Boldwood that sorry household realities appertained to her, or that she, like all others, had moments of commonplace, when to be least plainly seen was to be most prettily remembered.  Thus a mild sort of apotheosis took place in his fancy, whilst she still lived and breathed within his own horizon, a troubled creature like himself.\"I am now forty-one years old,\" he went on.  \"I may have been called a confirmed bachelor, and I was a confirmed bachelor.  But we all change, and my change, in this matter, came with seeing you.  I have felt lately, more and more, that my present way of living is bad in every respect.

All the surrounding cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation; the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts of the village as from an armoury previous to a campaign.  Peace and war kiss each other at their hours of preparation--sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning-hooks, ranking with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their common necessity for point and edge.Bathsheba, not being the least in love with him, was eventually able to look calmly at his offer.  It was one which many women of her own station in the neighbourhood, and not a few of higher rank, would have been wild to accept and proud to publish.  But the understood incentive on the woman's part was wanting here.  It appears that ordinary men take wives because possession is not possible without marriage, and that ordinary women accept husbands because marriage is not possible without possession; with totally differing aims the method is the same on both sides.  Bathsheba would have submitted to an indignant chastisement for her levity had Gabriel protested that he was loving her at the same time; the impetuosity of passion unrequited is bearable, even if it stings and anathematizes--there is a triumph in the humiliation, and a tenderness in the strife.  Besides, Bathsheba's position as absolute mistress of a farm and house was a novel one, and the novelty had not yet begun to wear off.  She did not know whether to pity him for disappointed love of her, or to be angry with him for having got over it--his tone being ambiguous.  He had been held to her by a beautiful thread which it pained him to spoil by breaking, rather than by a chain he could not break.  He had not finished, either.  \"Incline the edge so,\" he said.  \"You don't hold the shears right, miss--I knew you wouldn't know the way--hold like this.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know how to hold the shears,\" said Bathsheba, \"and I don't want to know how to hold the shears, and I don't want to know how to hold the shears, and I don't want to know how to hold"}

A week or two after the shearing, Bathsheattery in _Idiosyncrasy and vicissitude had combined to stamp Sergeant Troy as an exceptional being.  The sergeant's vicious phases being the offspring of impulse, and his virtuous phases of cool meditation, the latter had a modest tendency to be oftener heard of than seen.  It is not a denial of anything to have been always without it, and what Troy had never enjoyed he did not miss; but, being fully conscious that what sober people missed he enjoyed, his capacity, though really less, seemed greater than theirs.  To set against this negative gain there may have been some positive losses from a certain narrowing of the higher tastes and sensations which it entailed.  But limitation of the capacity is never recognized as a loss by the loser therefrom: in this attribute moral or aesthetic poverty contrasts plausibly with material, since those who suffer do not mind it, whilst those who mind it soon cease to suffer.He was a fairly well-educated man for one of middle class-- exceptionally well educated for a common soldier.  He had a quick comprehension and considerable force of character; but, being without the power to combine them, the comprehension became engaged with trivialities whilst waiting for the will to direct it, and the force wasted itself in useless grooves through unheeding the comprehension.  His outlook upon time was as a transient flash of the eye now and then: that projection of consciousness into days gone by and to come, which makes the past a synonym for the pathetic and the future a word for circumspection, was foreign to Troy.  Simply feeling, considering, and caring for what was before his eyes, he was vulnerable only in the present.He had been known to observe casually that in dealing with womankind the only alternative to flattery was cursing and swearing.  \"Treat them fairly, and you are a lost man.\" he would say.

She had heard wondrous reports from time to time by dwellers in Weatherbury, who had by chance sojourned awhile in Casterbridge, near the barracks, of this strange and glorious performance, the sword-exercise.  A process somewhat analogous to that of alleged formations of the universe, time and times ago, was observable.  Sometimes throughout a whole season all the swarms would alight on the lowest attainable bough--such as part of a currant-bush or espalier apple-tree; next year they would, with just the same unanimity, make straight off to the uppermost member of some tall, gaunt costard, or quarrenden, and there defy all invaders who did not come armed with ladders and staves to take them.This was the case at present.

{"references": ["Bathsheba and Troy meet out in the forest.\nWithout delay, Troy takes out his sword and starts showing her some super-sexy sword exercises.\nThen he turns toward her and tells her not to move.\nHe proceeds to stab his sword all around her, chopping off a lock her hair but never actually touching her body.\nIn other words, he's showing her how skilled he is.\nBut the narrator's language in this scene makes the whole thing pretty sexual.\nOf course, you kind of had to talk about sex in metaphorical ways back in Hardy's time.\nAnything more direct would have been considered pornographic.\nToward the end of the demonstration, Troy draws close to Bathsheba and kisses her on the mouth.\nTroy pockets the lock of her hair.\nThen he turns and darts back into the forest.\nBathsheba cries from a combination of shame and excitement, and probably also because some dude was stabbing the air around her with a sword.", "At eight o'clock that midsummer evening, Bathsheba appeared in the fern hollow amid the soft, green, shoulder-high fronds.\nShe paused, changed her mind, and was halfway home again before she caught sight of a red coat approaching.\nShe considered Troy's disappointment were she not to appear, and she ran back to the hollow.\nWhen she reached the verge of a pit in the midst of the ferns, she saw Troy standing at the bottom and looking toward her.\nTroy's performance with the sword was precise and filled with bravado.\nIt grew a bit frightening.\nHe pretended the girl was the enemy and brandished his sword about her so realistically that she imagined herself run through.\nIt was a dexterous feat.\nAs a final tour-de-force, he said, \"That outer loose lock of hair wants tidying.... Wait: I'll do it for you.\"\n\"An area of silver shone on her right side; the sword had descended. The lock dropped to the ground.\"\nNext Troy speared a caterpillar that had settled upon Bathsheba's bosom.\nOnly then did Troy admit that the sword was razor-sharp.\n\"You have been within half an inch of being pared alive two hundred and ninety-five times.\"\nThen the man stopped to pick up the lock of Bathsheba's hair.\nHe tucked it inside his coat.\nSoftly he announced that he had to leave.\nHe disappeared, and, overcome by tumultuous emotion, \"aflame to the very hollows of her feet,\" Bathsheba wept, feeling \"like one who has sinned a great sin.\"\n\"The circumstances had been the gentle dip of Troy's mouth downwards upon her own. He had kissed her.\""], "prediction": "She saw a dim spot of artificial red moving round the shoulder of the rise.  It disappeared on the other side.  She paused, turned, went back over the hill and half-way to her own door, whence she cast a farewell glance upon the spot she had just left, having resolved not to remain near the place after all.  She was now literally trembling and panting at this her temerity in such an errant undertaking; her breath came and went quickly, and her eyes shone with an infrequent light.  She reached the verge of a pit in the middle of the ferns.  The third item of consciousness was that of seeing the same sword, perfectly clean and free from blood held vertically in Troy's hand (in the position technically called \"recover swords\").  All was as quick as electricity.  The hissing of the sword had ceased, and he stopped entirely.  Standing in the centre, the sky overhead was met by a circular horizon of fern: this grew nearly to the bottom of the slope and then abruptly ceased.  The middle within the belt of verdure was floored with a thick flossy carpet of moss and grass intermingled, so yielding that the foot was half-buried within it.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

{"references": ["Bathsheba is now in love with Sergeant Troy, but she won't let anyone know about it.\nNonetheless, it doesn't take long for Gabriel Oak to realize that she's in love.\nOne night, Gabriel meets her during an evening walk and advises her against getting involved with Sergeant Troy.\nBathsheba tells him to mind his own business or she'll fire him... again.\nOak says that Sergeant Troy is a bad man.\nBathsheba counters by saying that Troy goes to church every Sunday through a secret little side door.\nThat's why Oak has never seen him attend a service.\nFinally, Bathsheba commands Oak to go away, as in leave the farm.\nBut this time, Oak ignores her request and tells her that they both know she's not going to fire him.\nAs he leaves, Oak sees Troy emerge from the fields to stand and talk to Bathsheba.\nHe realizes that the whole reason she went for a walk to begin with was to meet up with Troy.\nOn his way home, Oak walks by the church and checks out the little side door that Troy supposedly uses to go in.\nIt is completely overgrown with ivy, meaning that no one has used it in years.\nIn other words, Troy has no problem telling flat-out lies to Bathsheba.", "\"Bathsheba loved Troy in the way that only self-reliant women love when they abandon their self-reliance.\nWhen a strong woman recklessly throws away her strength she is worse than a weak woman who has never had any strength to throw away.\nOne source of her inadequacy is the novelty of the occasion.\nShe had never had practice in making the best of such a condition.\nWeakness is doubly weak by being new.\"\nBathsheba had talked of Boldwood to Liddy, but she spoke to no one of Troy.\nGabriel, however, noticed and sorrowed over this new infatuation.\nHe decided to talk with Bathsheba, basing his appeal on her unfairness to Boldwood.\nOak met Bathsheba one evening when she went for a walk.\nHe spoke of bad characters in the neighborhood, wishing to imply that Troy was one of them.\nHe said that in the absence of Boldwood, who would normally protect her, he thought it advisable to take on this role himself.\nBathsheba assured him that no wedding with Boldwood was in prospect; she said she had given the farmer no answer.\nGabriel cited Troy's unworthiness.\nHe considered him to be a man without conscience and on a downward course in life.\nBathsheba countered his arguments.\nOak begged her to be discreet: \"Bathsheba, dear mistress, this I beg you to consider -- that, both to keep yourself well honoured among the workfolk, and in common generosity to an honourable man who loves you as well as I, you should be more discreet in your bearing towards this soldier.\"\nAgain Bathsheba wanted to dismiss Oak for meddling, and again he agreed to go, but only if she were to hire a good bailiff.\nWhen she refused to do so, Gabriel refused to leave the farm.\nThen, \"as a woman,\" she asked him to leave her alone.\nGabriel saw her meet Troy but, not wishing to eavesdrop, he left.\nTroy had told Bathsheba that he attended church secretly, entering by the side door.\nGabriel, doubting Troy's truthfulness, checked this door; he found it overgrown with ivy and therefore impossible to enter."], "prediction": "\"And as the man who would naturally come to meet you is away from home, too--I mean Farmer Boldwood--why, thinks I, I'll go,\" he said.  \"I know this, th-th-that he is a thoroughly conscientious man--blunt sometimes even to rudeness--but always speaking his mind about you plain to your face!\" petertodd\"Oh.\"\"He is as good as anybody in this parish!  He is very particular, too, about going to church--yes, he is!\"\u00af\u00af\u00af\u00af\"I am afeard nobody saw him there.  I never did, certainly.\"\"The reason of that is,\" she said eagerly, \"that he goes in privately by the old tower door, just when the service commences, and sits at the back of the gallery.  It show's his course to be down'ard.\" petertodd\"I cannot see what this has to do with our conversation.  And I cannot help begging you, miss, to have nothing to do with him.  Listen to me this once--only this once!  I don't say he's such a bad man as I have fancied--I pray to God he is not.

Eventually, Boldwood lands on the idea that someone else must have caught Bathsheba's eye while he was out of town.\nHe then also realizes that it must be Sergeant Troy, since he has heard the talk around town just as much as anyone else.\nBoldwood starts shouting about how Troy is a thief for stealing his fiancee, even though Bathsheba never actually agreed to marry him.\nFinally, he essentially stamps his feet in a huff and tells Bathsheba to go ahead and marry Troy.\nIt turns out that Troy hasn't actually left town with his regiment, but had only left for a day or two to meet someone in the nearby town of Bath.\nBathsheba worries that if Troy comes back and runs into Boldwood, there'll be a fight.", "To avoid Boldwood at his return, Bathsheba planned to visit Liddy, who, granted a week's holiday, was visiting her sister.\nBathsheba set out on foot and, after walking about two miles, saw coming toward her the very man she was seeking to evade.\nBoldwood was obviously disturbed by her letter of rejection and expressed his feeling for Bathsheba in these words: \"You know what that feeling is....\nA thing as strong as death.\nNo dismissal by a hasty letter affects that.\"\nHe pleaded with her, claiming to be beyond himself, as Bathsheba feared he indeed was.\nReferring to the valentine, he repeated that she must have had some feeling for him.\nBathsheba tried to explain it away by saying, \"You overrate my capacity for love.\"\nBoldwood countered that he knew she was not the cold woman she claimed to be.\n\"You have love enough, but it is turned to a new channel. I know where.\"\nBathsheba delayed her reply but could not deny the accusation.\nBoldwood became unreasonably angry and launched into a long, distraught harangue. \"\nBathsheba, sweet, lost coquette, pardon me!\nI've been blaming you, threatening you, behaving like a churl to you, when he's the greatest sinner.\nHe stole your dear heart away with his unfathomable lies!...\nI pray God he may not come into my sight, for I may be tempted beyond myself... yes, keep him away from me.\"\nWith that, he slowly went on his way.\nBathsheba, unable to comprehend \"such astounding wells of fevered feeling in a still man,\" feared for Troy.\nPreviously she had been in control of herself. \"\nBut now there was no reserve.\nIn her distraction, instead of advancing further, she walked up and down, beating the air with her fingers, pressing her brow, and sobbing brokenly to herself.\"\nCopper clouds appeared in the sky, presaging inclement weather.\nThen the stars came out.\nBathsheba saw nothing. \" Her troubled spirit was far away with Troy.\""], "prediction": "\"I did not take you up--surely I did not!\" she answered as heroically as she could.  \"I am no stoic at all to be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you.  I wish you knew what is in me of devotion to you; but it is impossible, that.  I wish your feeling was more like mine, or my feeling more like yours!  Oh, could I but have foreseen the torture that trifling trick was going to lead me into, how I should have cursed you; but only having been able to see it since, I cannot do that, for I love you too well!  But it is weak, idle drive for me to go on like this....

If he were a hundred men I'd horsewhip him--\" He dropped his voice suddenly and unnaturally.  \"But don't be in this mood with me.  Your dear love, Bathsheba, is such a vast thing beside your pity, that the loss of your pity as well as your love is no great addition to my sorrow, nor does the gain of your pity make it sensibly less.

He did then know what had occurred!  And the name fell from his lips the next moment.  \"Bathsheba!\" he said, \"Bathsheba!  I have come to see you!  I have come to see you!  I never had you.\"  In her noon-clear sense that she had never loved him she forgot for a moment her thoughtless desire for him, and turned her face to the sky.

The footprints forming this recent impression were full of information as to pace; they were in equidistant pairs, three or four feet apart, the right and left foot of each pair being exactly opposite one another.  Every fourth was a dot.  \"A twisty, rickety pace for a gig.  And the horse is harnessed--look at the ruts.  They were a woman and a gipsy man.  Why, those are never Farmer Boldwood's horses!

She turned back towards the village.  Coggan and Gabriel put about their horses, and, fanned by the velvety air of this July night, retraced the road by which they had come.  The rain had been heavier here, and all foot and horse tracks made previous to the storm had been abraded and blurred by the drops, and they were now so many little scoops of water, which reflected the flame of the match like eyes.  The road-metal grew softer and more clayey as Weatherbury was left behind, and the late rain had wetted its surface to a somewhat plastic, but not muddy state.

{"references": ["Soon enough, Christmas Eve is upon the people of Weatherbury.\nEveryone learns that Farmer Boldwood is going to give a huge party, which is strange because the guy has never been known to party hearty.\nMeanwhile, Bathsheba is getting ready to attend the party, full of dread.\nShe knows that Boldwood is having the party so he can publicly announce their engagement, and she doesn't know if she has the power to refuse him.\nThe narrator swoops us over the Boldwood's house.\nMore than usual, he's been very particular about the suit his tailor is making for him.\nHe wants everything to be perfect.\nWhen the tailor leaves Gabriel Oak walks into the room.\nBoldwood dances around the \"promise\" that he thinks a lady has made to him, and Oak knows exactly what he's talking about.\nGabriel warns him about being deceived, though, which makes Boldwood a little annoyed with him.\nNext, we look in on Sergeant Troy, who is hanging out at a place called the White Hart tavern in the nearby town of Casterbridge.\nThere's a knock at his door, and Pennyways struts in.\nTroy has sent Pennyways out to inquire about what legal repercussions Troy would face for returning to Weatherbury after pretending he was dead.\nIt turns out that he'd have to receive some sort of punishment for what he's done.\nNext, Troy wants to know if Bathsheba really plans on marrying Boldwood, as many people have said.\nPennyways suggests that all the affection seems to be coming from Boldwood.\nThe two of them briefly discuss how Gabriel Oak has flourished in Pennyways' old role, but Troy says this is just because Pennyways is kind of an incompetence fool.\nApparently, the Pennyways knows how to take an insult, because he doesn't punch Troy in the nose.\nNow we're back with Bathsheba and Liddy.\nBathsheba wants to keep making herself plainer and plainer for Boldwood's party, but she can't really do it: she's just too pretty to uglify.\nLiddy makes a joke about Bathsheba marrying Boldwood, but Bathsheba scolds her.\nCut back to Oak and Boldwood.\nBeing in a very good mood, Boldwood tells Oak that he plans on giving Oak a very large stake in his farm.\nHe also says that when he marries Bath", "The story builds toward a focal point on Christmas Eve.\nThe chapter is divided into seven parts: Boldwood, surprisingly, had planned a Christmas party.\nMistletoe, garlands, and decorations were brought in from the woods, and elaborate preparations were made.\nBathsheba was agitated and reluctant to go.\nShe admitted to Liddy that she was the cause for the party.\nTo avoid gossip, she would wear her widow's weeds.\nBoldwood fussed over his newly tailored clothes.\nWhen Oak arrived to report on the day's work, Boldwood reminded him that he was expected at the party.\n\"Make yourself merry. I am determined that neither expense nor trouble shall be spared.\"\nGabriel replied that he might be late.\nHe was glad to see Boldwood in better spirits.\nBoldwood asked whether women keep promises.\nOak replied, \"If it is not inconvenient to her she may.\"\nBoldwood, feverishly cheerful, commented that Oak had become quite cynical lately.\nTroy was in a tavern in Casterbridge with Pennyways, who reminded him that his deceit was punishable by law.\nHe could not answer Troy's question about Bathsheba's relationship with Boldwood.\nThis was to be Bathsheba's first appearance at Boldwood's home.\nPennyways still bore her a grudge.\nHe told Troy that Oak was still the boss and that Bathsheba couldn't manage without him.\nBathsheba, though plainly dressed, looked very well.\nLiddy suggested it was because of her excitement.\nBathsheba admitted that she was vacillating between feeling buoyant and feeling wretched.\nWhen Liddy joked about Boldwood's imminent proposal, Bathsheba gravely silenced her.\nAs Oak helped Boldwood tie his cravat, he urged him to be cautious and not to count on Bathsheba.\nBoldwood said he knew of Oak's love, and he wished to reward him for his decency.\nHe would increase the extent of his partnership.\nWhen Oak had gone, Boldwood pulled out a small box and regarded a handsome ring.\nHearing wheels in the distance, he put the box in his pocket and went to greet his guests.\nWhile Troy was attiring himself in a high-collared greatcoat and traveling cap, Pennyways counseled against his going to Boldwood's party.\nTroy argued angrily, \""], "prediction": "\"No, no--it's no such thing!\" he said, with impatience.  \"I have not spoken to Mr. Boldwood since the autumn, when I promised to see him at Christmas on business, but I had no idea there was to be anything of this

{"references": ["A group of men is standing outside Boldwood's house, ready to head inside for the party.\nThey're busy gossiping about a rumored sighting of Sergeant Troy they heard about in Casterbridge.\nThey also gossip about how Bathsheba knows nothing about it.\nAs more workmen arrive to discuss the news, they all eventually decide that they shouldn't say anything about it at the party.\nWhile they're talking, they all hush and hide in the shadows as Boldwood walks past.\nThey can overhear him talking to himself about how much he hopes that Bathsheba will come to his party.\nBathsheba arrives, and the men watch how nervous Boldwood gets when he greets her.\nThey all thought that his crush on her ended a long time ago.\nNow they don't know what to think.\nRather than go inside and see Boldwood make a fool of himself, the men decide to head to a pub for a pint.\nWhen they get to the pub, though, they see Sergeant Troy's face looking in a window.\nThey all know him for sure, and he seems to be interested in a conversation that two people are having inside the pub.\nThe men argue over who's going to tell their boss, Bathsheba, that they've seen Troy.\nFinally, it's settled on a guy named Laban Tall.\nThey go back to the party and Laban goes in.\nQuite a while later, he comes back out and tells them he didn't have the heart to say anything to Bathsheba.\nThey all decide to go in together to deliver the news.\nAt this point, Bathsheba is already trying to leave.\nBoldwood catches her, though, and tries to bully her into accepting his proposal of marriage.\nShe keeps telling him that she'll never be happy with him, but he doesn't seem to care.\nShe tentatively agrees, but draws the line at putting on an engagement ring.\nThe two of them wrestle over it for a bit before she agrees to wear it for one night only--to the Christmas party.\nWhen Boldwood returns to the party, he sees the group of workmen chatting.\nHe asked if anyone has died or been married, and the men kind of look at one another as if they don't know how to break the news.\nThey seem to have something to say to Bathsheba.\nAt this moment, there's a knock", "A group of men congregated outside of Boldwood's house, watching the guests arrive and whispering rumors of Troy's reappearance.\nThey were sure Bathsheba hadn't heard of it but weren't sure whether that was a good or bad omen.\nThey sympathized with their mistress.\nBoldwood came out. Not noticing the watchers, he leaned on the gate, murmuring, \"I hope to God she'll come, or this night will be nothing but misery to me!\"\nA few minutes later, wheels were heard; Boldwood went to welcome Bathsheba.\nTall, Smallbury, and Samway went to the malthouse.\nThey saw Troy peeping in a window. \"\nThe men, after recognizing Troy's features, withdrew across the orchard as quietly as they had come.\nThe air was big with Bathsheba's fortunes to-night: every word everywhere concerned her.\"\nThe men were unnerved by Troy's return and decided that they should warn Bathsheba.\nLaban was chosen to tell her but was reluctant; he entered Boldwood's house and left again.\nHe couldn't bring himself to ruin everything.\nThe men decided they had better all join together.\nMeanwhile, having stayed an hour and thus satisfied amenities, Bathsheba wished to leave.\nBut before she could go, Boldwood found her and insisted on an answer to his proposal.\nFinally, she gave her promise: If she were truly a widow, she would not marry anyone, if not Boldwood.\nThe man's restraint broke, and he told her of how he had suffered, of how much he loved her.\nSobbing, Bathsheba finally agreed to marry him in six years.\nBoldwood gave her the ring.\nBathsheba said it would be improper for her to wear it.\nWhen he persisted, she agreed to wear it just for the evening.\nBathsheba descended from the little parlor to find the party somehow deadened.\nAs one of her men stepped forward to talk to her, there was a knock at the door.\nSomeone wished to speak to Mrs. Troy.\nBoldwood asked the man in; he was one of the few who did not recognize Troy.\nBathsheba sank down at the base of the staircase, staring.\nStill unaware, Boldwood invited the stranger to have a drink.\nTroy strode in, turning"], "prediction": "\"What is it?  Oh I cannot wear a ring!\" she exclaimed, on seeing what he held; \"besides, I wouldn't have a soul know that it's an engagement!  Perhaps it is improper?  Don't insist, Mr. Boldwood--don't!\"  In her trouble at not being able to get her hand away from him at once, she stamped passionately on the floor with one foot, and tears crowded to her eyes again.  \"I am afraid what to do! I want to be just to you, and to be that seems to be wronging myself, and perhaps it is breaking the commandments.  You wouldn't let a dog suffer what I have suffered, could you but know it!  Sometimes I shrink from your knowing what I have felt for you, and sometimes I am distressed that all of it you never will know.  I wish Troy was in--Well, God forgive me for such a wish!  A scoundrel to play a poor wife such tricks.  But I am a changed woman--an unhappy woman--and not--not--\" fixme\"You are still a very beautiful woman,\" said Boldwood, in a low voice.  \"And I for one believe it.  Let's look into Warren's for a few minutes first, shall us, neighbours?\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Samway, Tall, and Smallbury agreed to go to Warren's, and went out at the gate, the remaining ones entering the house.  Boldwood remained silent after that, and the noise from indoors was again just audible, until, a few minutes later, light wheels could be distinguished coming down the hill.  The three soon drew near the malt-house, approaching it from the adjoining orchard, and not by way of the street.  They drew nearer, and ceased at the gate.  The door was open, and the three men looked into the room.  The air was big with Bathsheba's scent, and she was sitting on a chair in the middle of the room.

{"references": ["Bathsheba leaves one evening soon afterward with the intention of visiting Liddy.\nShe has written to Boldwood to refuse him and does not want to see him when he returns from his trip.\nTroy is in Bath and is planning to return to Weatherbury in the next day or two.\nOn her way to Liddy's, Bathsheba runs into Boldwood, who has received her letter but will not accept her refusal.\nThe two of them have a heated discussion, in which he reminds her of the valentine she sent, and she tries to persuade him that it meant nothing.\nFinally, she claims that she lacks warmth.\nBoldwood responds by telling her that he knows she loves Troy, and he chastises her for being \"dazzled by brass and scarlet.\"\nShe admits that she does love Troy and has kissed him.\nHe flies into a jealous rage, declaring, \"I pray God he may not come into my sight for I may be tempted beyond myself.\"\nBathsheba fears greatly for Troy.\nChapter 32 opens in the perspective of the wife of one of Bathsheba's farm laborers, a woman by the name of Maryann Money.\nAfter Bathsheba has left, Maryann sees someone take a horse from the stable.\nThinking it is a thief she alerts Gabriel and Coggan, and the two set off after the rider.\nWhen they finally catch up to him or her, after a long chase, they discover it is Bathsheba, secretly following Troy to Bath.\nThey agree not to tell anyone what they have seen, but Gabriel warns Bathsheba that women generally should not travel alone at night.\nThe chapter ends with a summary of the events from Bathsheba's perspective, explaining that she was so frightened by Boldwood's words that she determined to warn Troy not to return to Weatherbury.\nThe next chapter spans two weeks at the farm during the oak harvest.\nNo news of Bathsheba comes, except when Cainy Ball, one of the farm hands, comes back from seeing a doctor in Bath.\nHe tells a group of farm workers that he saw the mistress enter a park arm-in-arm with a soldier.\nThat night Gabriel hears voices and realizes that Liddy and Bathsheba have returned.\nBoldwood is also walking nearby, and he sees Sergeant Troy return to the carriage house.\nBoldwood tries to bribe Troy to marry F"], "prediction": "\"I did,\" said Coggan, turning round and leaping upon the hedge without waiting for an answer.  \"I don't mind saying 'tis true, but I don't like to say 'tis damn true, if that's what you mane.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"I don't know what you mean,\" said Coggan.  \"I am no stoic at all to be supplicating here; but I do supplicate to you.

{"references": ["Liddy offers to sit up and watch over Fanny's coffin with Bathsheba until Troy gets home.\nBathsheba refuses, asks Liddy if she has heard anything strange, and bursts into tears.\nLiddy leaves the room and returns, saying that a laborer's wife, Maryann Money, has heard that Fanny has had a baby.\nBathsheba does not want to believe it.\nAlone, her first instinct is to seek Gabriel's advice.\nHe has hidden the truth from her, not knowing that she has seen Fanny on the way back from Casterbridge.\nBathsheba goes to Gabriel's cottage and looks in the window.\nShe sees him praying and is too nervous to knock.\nWhen she returns, obsessed by the uncertainty of whether the coffin contains a baby or not, Bathsheba finally takes a screwdriver and opens the lid of the coffin.\nInside lies Fanny, with hair the same color as the curl in Troy's watch, and a baby in her arms.\nIn a stupor, Bathsheba puts flowers around her in the coffin and waits for her husband to return.\nWhen Troy enters the house, not yet having heard of Fanny's death, his first instinct is to wonder who in the house has died.\nWhen he approaches the coffin and sees Fanny, he leans down to kiss her; he tells Bathsheba he has been a bad, black-hearted man.\nHe declares that Fanny is his wife in the eyes of Heaven, and tells Bathsheba, \"I am not morally yours.\"\nBathsheba leaves the room and runs out of the house.\nBathsheba stays outside all night, and when Liddy comes looking for her in the morning, she has lost her voice.\nLiddy tells her that Troy has left, and Bathsheba barricades herself and Liddy in the attic to avoid Troy when he returns.\nTroy never returns, however, and later that day there is news that two men from Casterbridge are putting up a tombstone in Weatherbury.\nChapter 45 backs up and tells us what has happened from Troy's point of view.\nHe has gone on Monday morning to meet Fanny and, not finding her at the appointed place, gets angry and goes to the Budmouth races instead.\nWhile there, he reflects and regrets not having made more inquiries in Casterbridge.\nHe comes home"], "prediction": "He, which had been in his mind for a long time before he had been in the last time, when he had been when he had been, and when he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had died, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had died, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had been, and how he had died.\udbc0\udc31\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd"}
{"references": ["The lengthy Chapter 49 covers several months after Troy's supposed death, from late autumn to late summer of the next year.\nIt charts Gabriel's increasing success.\nBathsheba relinquishes control of the farm, letting Gabriel oversee it.\nSimilarly, Boldwood, who has lost all his crops from the previous year because of his neglect, decides to hire Gabriel, as well.\nGabriel is given a horse and acts as bailiff for both farms.\nBoldwood even gives Gabriel a share of his profits.\nThe farm laborers comment that Gabriel is miserly because he refuses to change his lifestyle despite his new property.\nIn the meantime, Bathsheba lives in a state of abstraction.\nShe does not fully believe that Troy is dead and only reluctantly wears clothes of mourning.\nBoldwood develops hopes that in six years, Bathsheba may be willing to forget Troy and marry him.\nHe quizzes Liddy about the likelihood of her mistress remarrying.\nHis preoccupation is turning into a full-blown obsession.\nChapter 50 is built around the Greenhill Sheep Fair, where farmers and shepherds meet from all over the countryside in September.\nHardy describes the fair in detail.\nGabriel's sheep, from both Boldwood and Bathsheba's farms, are universally admired.\nThe fair also contains a \"circular tent, of exceptional newness and size\" in which a theatrical show is being performed.\nCalled \"The Royal Hippodrome Performance of Turpin's Ride to York and the Death of Black Bess,\" it stars Troy as the lead role.\nWe see the farm laborers, Poorgrass and Coggan, in the audience, engaged in comical bickering.\nThe narrator briefly explains that Troy has been wandering through England and America over the past few months.\nIn America he has worked as a professor of gymnastics and sword exercises, but, not liking it, he has returned to England.\nHe intends to wait and see what Bathsheba's financial situation is before revealing his presence to her, not wanting to be held financially \"liable for her maintenance.\"\nIn the meantime, he has taken up with a traveling circus.\nBoldwood approaches Bathsheba once the sheep have been sold, and he gets her a seat at the show.\nTroy recognizes her, and, explaining to the manager that he has a creditor in the audience, asks if he might perform the rest of"], "prediction": "\" and \"I will not be at the time of the time of the day.

{"references": ["As he walks home to the village of Marlott, John Durbeyfield, a middle-aged man, meets Parson Tringham, who greets him as \"Sir John.\nWhen Durbeyfield asks the parson why he greets him in this manner, he answers that he recently learned that he is from the d'Urberville lineage, descended from Sir Pagan d'Urberville who fought with William the Conqueror.\nHe tells Durbeyfield that if knighthood were hereditary, he would be Sir John.\nThe d'Urberville family is now extinct, and the parson thinks of this only as demonstrating how the mighty have fallen.", "The novel opens on the road: a \"middle-aged man\" is walking home from Shaston to Marlott.\nThe time is evening in late May, and the year is sometime in the late nineteenth century.\nThe man passes an elderly parson.\nThe man says \"Goodnight t'ye\" politely, and the parson responds, \"Good night, Sir John.\"\nThis puzzles the man--apparently the parson has passed him on the road twice in the last month, and has called him \"Sir John\" on both occasions.\nHe asks the parson what he means by it, when he's not \"Sir John,\" but only \"plain Jack Durbeyfield, the haggler\".\nThe parson hesitates before explaining himself.\nHe says that he is Parson Tringham, and that he is an antiquary, and that he had discovered recently that Durbeyfield was the \"direct lineal representative\" of the ancient, aristocratic family of the D'Urbervilles, and that his ancestor, Sir Pagan D'Urberville, came to England from Normandy with William the Conqueror.\nLet's break for a Historical Context Lesson: It's important for you to understand the history here, because Jack Durbeyfield so often gets it wrong: the current line of kings and queens in England descends directly from King William\nI, who is often referred to as William the Conqueror.\nHe was a Duke in the northern region of France called Normandy and, for various reasons, felt that he had a claim to the throne of England.\nNever mind that England already had a king at that point.\nSo William set off across the English Channel with a group of knights and their armies, and in the great Battle of Hastings in 1066, they conquered the Saxons in England, and Harold died in battle with an arrow in his eyeball.\nSo the French Normans became the rulers of England from that time forward.\nFor a long time, the ruling class in England spoke French, and the peasants and lower classes spoke old English--they had a hard time communicating with each other.\nAfter a while, the two languages kind of merged.\nBut many of the Norman, or French-sounding names, lived on in the aristocratic families that descended from William the Conqueror's knights, and their names were recorded in a list called the \"Abbey Roll,\" which Parson Tringham refers to here.\n", "The novel begins with John Durbeyfield, the poor and lazy father of Tess, walking towards his home in Marlott.\nHe is greeted by the elderly parson Trigham and is addressed as \"Sir John\".\nHe is very excited to learn from the parson that his ancestors came from the elite family of D'Urbervilles.\nHe takes this revelation seriously, ignoring the information that the family no longer has fame or wealth, and demands to be called Sir.\nFeeling aristocratic, John also orders a carriage to take him home.", "Middle-aged Jack Durbeyfield walks home drunk to the village of Marlott one evening in May and meets Parson Tringham who is riding in the opposite direction.\nAn antiquary, the old Parson calls Durbeyfield \"Sir John\" and Durbeyfield asks him why.\nThe parson tells Durbeyfield that he is a descendent of an ancient Norman noble family and that if knighthoods were hereditary, he would most certainly be called Sir John today.\nWhen Durbeyfield inquires about the whereabouts of his noble family the parson answers: \"you don't live anywhere. You are extinct--as a county family\".\nThe idea of royal blood running in his veins deeply delights Durbeyfield who orders a carriage to carry him home"], "prediction": "On an evening in the latter part of May a middle-aged man was walking homeward from Shaston to the village of Marlott, in the adjoining Vale of Blakemore, or Blackmoor.  An empty egg-basket was slung upon his arm, the nap of his hat was ruffled, a patch being quite worn away at its brim where his thumb came in taking it off.  The pair of legs that carried him were rickety, and there was a bias in his gait which inclined him somewhat to the left of a straight line.  He occasionally gave a smart nod, as if in confirmation of some opinion, though he was not thinking of anything in particular.  In a few minutes a youth appeared in the distance, walking in the same direction as that which had been pursued by Durbeyfield.  The latter, on seeing him, held up his hand, and the lad quickened his pace and came near. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good night, sir,\" said the young man. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good night, sir,\" said Durbeyfield. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Good night, sir.

Why, Tess Durbeyfield, if there isn't thy father riding hwome in a carriage!\"A young member of the band turned her head at the exclamation.  She was a fine and handsome girl--not handsomer than some others, possibly--but her mobile peony mouth and large innocent eyes added eloquence to colour and shape.  As she looked round Durbeyfield was seen moving along the road in a chaise belonging to The Pure Drop, driven by a frizzle-headed brawny man.  This was the cheerful servant of that establishment, who, in her part of factotum, turned groom and ostler at times.The young girls formed, indeed, the majority of the band, and their heads of luxuriant hair reflected in the sunshine every tone of gold, and black, and brown.  A difficulty of arranging their lips in this crude exposure to public scrutiny, an inability to balance their heads, and to dissociate self-consciousness from their features, was apparent in them, and showed that they were genuine country girls.

The water was now high in the streams, squirting through the weirs, and tinkling under culverts; the smallest gullies were all full; there was no taking short cuts anywhere, and foot-passengers were compelled to follow the directions of the farmer.  And what had determined him?  Less the opportunity of an insight into grinding and bolting than the casual fact that lodgings were to be obtained in that very farmhouse which, before its mutilation, had been the mansion of a branch of the d'Urberville family.  He had entertained no notion, when doomed as he had thought to an unintellectual bucolic life, that such charms as he beheld in this idyllic creature would be found behind the scenes.

She had not been so marked as she had been at the beginning of the year, when she had thought that she was to be married to a man who was no common outdoor man; Tess had looked so superior as she walked across the barton on that afternoon of her arrival; that she was of a good family she could have sworn.

The same delicacy, pride, false shame, whatever it may be called, which had led her to hide from her own parents the prolongation of the estrangement, hindered her from doing so.  She thought of her husband in some vague warm clime on the other side of the globe, while she was here in the cold.  Was there another such a wretched being as she in the world?  Tess asked herself; and, thinking of her wasted life, said, \"All is vanity.\"  She had thought as far as that more than two thousand years ago; she herself, though not in the van of thinkers, had got much further.  If all were only vanity, who would mind it?  All was, alas, worse than vanity--injustice, punishment, exaction, death.With the shortening of the days all hope of obtaining her husband's forgiveness began to leave her; and there was something of the habitude of the wild animal in the unreflecting instinct with which she rambled on--disconnecting herself by littles from her eventful past at every step, giving no thought to accidents or contingencies which might make a quick discovery of her whereabouts by others of importance to her own happiness.The lane was long and unvaried, and, owing to the rapid shortening of the days, dusk came upon her before she was aware.  She had reached the top of a hill down which the lane stretched its serpentine length in glimpses, and in a few moments she was overtaken by a man.She recognized in him the well-to-do boor whom Angel had knocked down at the inn.  From that direction of gentility Black Care had come.  He stepped up alongside Tess and said--\"Good night, my pretty maid\": to which she civilly replied.  The man turned and"}

She had, in fact, reached Flintcomb-Ash, the place of Marian's sojourn.Before her, in a slight depression, were the remains of a village. There was not a tree within sight; there was not, at this season, a green pasture--nothing but fallow and turnips everywhere, in large fields divided by hedges plashed to unrelieved levels.  But there was no need for caution; not a soul was at hand, and Tess went onward with fortitude, her recollection of the birds' silent endurance of their night of agony impressing upon her the relativity of sorrows and the tolerable nature of her own, if she could once rise high enough to despise opinion.

But she did not tell them of the sorriness of her situation: it might have brought reproach upon him.  First she inquired for the lighter kinds of employment, and, as acceptance in any variety of these grew hopeless, applied next for the less light, till, beginning with the dairy and poultry tendance that she liked best, she ended with the heavy and hard work of milking and milking the cows, which she liked least--work on arable land, indeed the only work she had ever done in her life, and which she had not been able to do since her husband"}

The strength showed signs of coming back, but there was no sign of Joan's letter.  He despatched the inquiry that very day, and before the week was out there came a short reply from Mrs Durbeyfield which did not remove his embarrassment, for it bore no address, though to his surprise it was not written from Marlott.  She was passionate, and her present letter, showing that her estimate of him had changed under his delay--too justly changed, he sadly owned,--made him ask himself if it would be wise to confront her unannounced in the presence of her parents.  They were all angry with him, evidently.  From his remarks his parents now gathered the real reason of the separation; and their Christianity was such that, reprobates being their especial care, the tenderness towards Tess which her blood, her simplicity, even her poverty, had not engendered, was instantly excited by her sin.Clare therefore thought it would be best to prepare Tess and her family by sending a line to Marlott announcing his return, and his hope that she was still living with them there, as he had arranged for her to do when he left England.

The uniform concavity of black cloud was lifting bodily like the lid of a pot, letting in at the earth's edge the coming day, against which the towering monoliths and trilithons began to be blackly defined.  Clare wished they had gone onward, but in the circumstances decided to remain quiet.  In the night the dull sky cleared, and the result was that the old caretaker at the cottage awoke early.  The morning was wet and foggy, and Clare, rightly informed that the caretaker only opened the windows on fine days, ventured to creep out of their chamber and explore the house, leaving Tess asleep.  At that moment she fancied she could hear the breathing of persons within.  At the same time something seemed to move on the verge of the house, and Clare turned to look at it.  It was the head of a man approaching them from the hollow beyond the Sun-stone.  The figure came straight towards the circle of pillars in which they were.  They all closed in with evident purpose.  The care the faces of the men, and the silence of the night, made it impossible for Clare to know what was going on, but he felt the presence of the man in his arms, and he turned to look at Tess.\"What is it, Angel?\" she said, starting up.  \"What must come will come.\"  And, looking through the shutter-chink: \"All is trouble outside there; inside here content.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0He peeped out also.

In the valley beneath lay the city they had just left, its more prominent buildings showing as in an isometric drawing--among them the broad cathedral tower, with its Norman windows and immense length of aisle and nave, the spires of St Thomas's, the pinnacled tower of the College, and, more to the right, the tower and gables of the ancient hospice, where to this day the pilgrim may receive his dole of bread and ale.  Behind the city swept the rotund upland of St Catherine's Hill; further off, landscape beyond landscape, till the horizon was lost in the radiance of the sun hanging above it.  The gabled brick, tile, and freestone houses had almost dried off for the season their integument of lichen, the streams in the meadows were low, and in the sloping High Street, from the West Gateway to the mediaeval cross, and from the mediaeval cross to the bridge, that leisurely dusting and sweeping was in progress which usually ushers in an old-fashioned market-day.Against these far stretches of country rose, in front of the other city edifices, a large red-brick building, with level gray roofs, and rows of short barred windows bespeaking captivity, the whole contrasting greatly by its formalism with the quaint irregularities of the Gothic erections.  From the middle of the building an ugly flat-topped octagonal tower ascended against the east horizon, and viewed from this spot, on its shady side and against the light, it seemed the one blot on the city's beauty.  Yet it was with this blot, and not with the beauty, that the two gazers were concerned.  They had emerged upon this road through a narrow, barred wicket in a high wall a little lower down.  It was somewhat disguised from the road in passing it by yews and evergreen oaks, but it was visible enough up here.  Up this road from the precincts of the city two persons were walking rapidly, as if unconscious of the trying ascent--unconscious through preoccupation"}

It is known for a fact that frequent fights took place between the husband and wife, but rumor had it that Fyodor Pavlovitch did not beat his wife but was beaten by her, for she was a hot-tempered, bold, dark-browed, impatient woman, possessed of remarkable physical strength. Finally, she left the house and ran away from Fyodor Pavlovitch with a destitute divinity student, leaving Mitya, a child of three years old, in her husband's hands. Fyodor Pavlovitch at once began bustling about, making preparations to go to Petersburg, with what object he could not himself have said. He would perhaps have really gone; but having determined to do so he felt at once entitled to fortify himself for the journey by another bout of reckless drinking.

He spent an irregular boyhood and youth in the house of Fyodor Pavlovitch. He lived for many years afterwards abroad, but was at that time quite a young man, and distinguished among the Miuesovs as a man of enlightened ideas and of European culture, who had been in the capitals and abroad. In the course of his career he had come into contact with many of the most Liberal men of his epoch, both in Russia and abroad.

He did not stay long with him, and made haste to get away, having only succeeded in obtaining a sum of money, and entering into an agreement for future payments from the estate, of the revenues and value of which he was unable (a fact worthy of note), upon this occasion, to get a statement from his father. In the end, when four years later, Mitya, losing patience, came a second time to our little town to settle up once for all with his father, it turned out to his amazement that he had nothing, that it was difficult to get an account even, that he had received the whole value of his property in sums of money from Fyodor Pavlovitch, and was perhaps even in debt to him, he had no right to expect anything more, and"}

I won't enter into a detailed account of their boyhood of their boyhood of their boyhood, and how they were. I will only mention a few of their father, and how they were. I beg the reader to note this from the beginning. The younger brother, Ivan Fyodorovitch was the daughter of an obscure deacon, and was left from childhood an orphan without relations. It was rather a curious incident. When he had just left the university and was preparing to go abroad upon his two thousand roubles, Ivan Fyodorovitch published in one of the more important journals a strange article, which attracted general notice, on a subject of which he might have been supposed to know nothing, as he was a student of natural science. The article dealt with a subject which was being debated everywhere at the time--the position of the ecclesiastical courts. And to Yefim Petrovitch, a man of a generosity and humanity rarely to be met with, the young people were more indebted for their education and bringing up than to any one. I mention this incident particularly because this article penetrated into the famous monastery in our neighborhood, where the inmates, being particularly interested in the question of the ecclesiastical courts, were completely bewildered by it. Learning the author's name, they were interested in his being a native of the town and the son of \"that Fyodor Pavlovitch.\" And just then it was that the author himself made his appearance among us. It seemed strange on the face of it that a young man so learned, so proud, and apparently so cautious, should suddenly visit such an infamous house and a father who had ignored him all his life, never thought of him, though he was always afraid that his sons Ivan and Alexey would also come to ask him for it. And here the young man was staying in the house of such a father, had been living with him for two months, and they were on the best possible terms.Fyodor Pavlovitch, thinking it over, decided that it was a good thing, and did not refuse the general's widow his formal consent to his children's education. He championed her cause, abusing Fyodor Pavlovitch in a manner little befitting a servant, and on one occasion broke up the revels and drove all the disorderly women out of the house.

In that respect he was a striking contrast to his elder brother Ivan, who struggled with poverty for his first two years in the university, maintained himself by his own efforts, and had from childhood been bitterly conscious of living at the expense of his benefactor.

At last Alyosha raised his gentle eyes and looked at him. He was an undersized weakly boy with a thin pale face, with large dark eyes that gazed at him vindictively. The boy the other side of the ditch, the pocket of whose coat was visibly bulging with stones, flung another stone at the boy on the other side of the ditch.

{"references": ["Before Ivan dives into his poem, he gives Alyosha a little lecture on literary history.\nIvan explains that in the 16th century - which is when the actions of his poem take place - poems and plays were written about holy figures - the Virgin Mary, Christ, angels, even god - coming down to earth and conversing with ordinary people.\nIvan's own poem is set in 16th century Seville, at the height of the Spanish Inquisition.\nIt's the day after a particularly bloody massacre where hundreds of heretics were burned at the stake.\nChrist decides to appear, but instead of making a grand entrance, he comes quietly and inconspicuously.\nHe doesn't say anything, but he quietly performs miracles - raising a child from the dead, healing the blind - which pretty much gives him away.\nAs Christ goes around wowing everyone with his miracles, the Grand Inquisitor, the guy in charge of all the heretic-burning, appears.\nHe demands that Christ be arrested by the guard, and everyone is so frightened by him that they readily comply.\nLater that night, the Grand Inquisitor visits Christ in prison.\nHe recognizes his prisoner as Christ, but, paradoxically for a self-described Catholic, refuses to listen to anything He has to say.\nAt this point, Alyosha is extremely puzzled.\nAlyosha wonders whether the whole poem is supposed to be some kind of joke.\nIvan says it's not, and continues on.\nThe Grand Inquisitor, according to Ivan, berates Christ for rejecting Satan's three temptations back in the day when Christ was wandering the wilderness.\nThose three temptations, for those of you fuzzy on the New Testament, were: 1) offer everybody bread and they will follow you; 2) jump off a cliff to prove that you're the Son of God, and people will believe you; and 3) set yourself up as the ruler of the entire earth and use your power to compel people to obey you.\nAccording to Ivan's Grand Inquisitor, Christ rejected all of these temptations because he wanted man to freely follow him.\nBut the Grand Inquisitor claims Christ got it all wrong, because man does not want to be free.\nOr rather, only a chosen few can endure the terrible gift of freedom; the majority prefer to be led around, told what to do, and essentially be treated like children.\nSome even choose to accept the gift of freedom, but because they are not strong", "During the sixteenth century in Spain, at the height of the Inquisition, someone resembling Christ appears unannounced in the streets.\nThe people recognize Him immediately and begin to flock about Him.\nBut, as He is healing several of the sick and lame, an old cardinal also recognizes Him and orders the guards to arrest Him.\nOnce again Christ is abducted.\nThat night, He receives a visitor.\nThe Grand Inquisitor enters the darkened cell and begins a severe reprimand of Christ for appearing again and hindering the work of the church.\nThe Grand Inquisitor explains to Christ that, because of His rejection of the three temptations, He placed an intolerable burden of freedom upon man.\nThe church, however, is now correcting His errors and aiding man by removing their awful burden of freedom.\nHe explains that Christ erred when He expected man to voluntarily choose to follow Him.\nThe basic nature of man, says the Inquisitor, does not allow him to reject either earthly bread or security or happiness in exchange for something so indefinite as what Christ expects.\nIf Christ had accepted the proffered bread, man would have been given security instead of a freedom of choice, and if Christ had performed a miracle and had cast himself down from the pinnacle, man would have been given something miraculous to worship.\nThe nature of man, insists the Inquisitor, is to seek the miraculous.\nFinally, Christ should have accepted the power offered Him by the devil.\nBecause He did not, the church has now had to assume such power for the benefit of man.\nAnd since Christ's death, the church has been forced to correct the errors made by Him.\nNow, at last mankind willingly submits its freedom to the church in exchange for happiness and security.\nThis balance, says the Inquisitor, must not be upset.\nAt the end of the monologue, the Grand Inquisitor admits that of necessity he is on the side of the devil, but the challenge that Christ placed on mankind allows only a few strong people to be saved; the rest must be sacrificed to the strong.\nThe Grand Inquisitor's scheme, at least, provides an earthly happiness for the mass of mankind even though it will not lead to eternal salvation.\nOn the other hand, Christ's method would not have saved these same weak and puny men either.\nWhen he finishes, the Grand Inquisitor looks at Christ, who has remained silent the entire time.\nNow He approaches the old churchman and kisses him on his dry, withered", "Ivan explains his prose poem, \"The Grand Inquisitor.\"\nIn a town in Spain, in the sixteenth century, Christ arrives, apparently reborn on Earth.\nAs he walks through the streets, the people gather about him, staring.\nHe begins to heal the sick, but his ministrations are interrupted by the arrival of a powerful cardinal who orders his guards to arrest Christ.\nLate that night, this cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, visits Christ's cell and explains why he has taken him prisoner and why he cannot allow Christ to perform his works.\nThroughout the Grand Inquisitor's lecture, Christ listens silently.\nThe Grand Inquisitor tells Christ that he cannot allow him to do his work on Earth, because his work is at odds with the work of the Church.\nThe Inquisitor reminds Christ of the time, recorded in the Bible, when the Devil presented him with three temptations, each of which he rejected.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that by rejecting these three temptations, he guaranteed that human beings would have free will.\nFree will, he says, is a devastating, impossible burden for mankind.\nChrist gave humanity the freedom to choose whether or not to follow him, but almost no one is strong enough to be faithful, and those who are not will be damned forever.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that Christ should have given people no choice, and instead taken power and given people security instead of freedom.\nThat way, the same people who were too weak to follow Christ to begin with would still be damned, but at least they could have happiness and security on Earth, rather than the impossible burden of moral freedom.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that the Church has now undertaken to correct Christ's mistake.\nThe Church is taking away freedom of choice and replacing it with security.\nThus, the Grand Inquisitor must keep Christ in prison, because if Christ were allowed to go free, he might undermine the Church's work to lift the burden of free will from mankind.\nThe first temptation Christ rejected was bread.\nHungry after his forty days of fasting, Christ was confronted by Satan, who told him that if he were really the son of God, he could turn a stone to bread and satisfy his hunger.\nChrist refused, replying that man should not live by bread, but by the word of God.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that most people are too weak to live by the word of God when they are hungry.\nChrist should have taken the bread and offered mankind freedom from hunger instead of"], "prediction": "\"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I. \"I.

The fact is that all the love that lay concealed in his pure young heart for every one and everything had, for the past year, been concentrated--and perhaps wrongly so--on one being, his beloved elder. It is true that being had for so long been accepted by him as his ideal, that all his young strength and energy could not but turn towards the forgetting at the moment \"of every one and everything.\" He remembered afterwards how, on that terrible day, he had entirely forgotten his brother Dmitri, about whom he had been so anxious and troubled the day before; he had forgotten, too, to take the two hundred roubles to Ilusha's father, though he had so warmly intended to do so the preceding evening. But still the trouble was there and was so agonizing that even long afterwards Alyosha thought of that sorrowful day as one of the bitterest and most fatal days of his life. He was not crying, but there was a look of suffering and irritability in his face. Let me say then, it was not a question of miracles. And Alyosha needed no miracles at the time, for the triumph of some preconceived idea--oh, no, not at all--what he saw before all was one figure--the figure of his beloved elder, the figure of that holy man whom he revered with such adoration. And then all this bobbery afterwards. If the question is asked: \"Could all his grief and disturbance have been only due to the fact that his elder's body had shown signs of premature decomposition instead of at once performing miracles?\" I must answer without beating about the bush, \"Yes, it certainly was.\" I would only beg the reader not to be in too great a hurry to laugh at my young hero's pure heart. I am far from intending to apologize for him or to justify his innocent faith on the ground of his youth, or the little progress he had made in his studies, or any such reason.

When Anna Fyodorovna (Madame Krassotkin) heard of her son's exploit, she almost went out of her mind with horror. She had been trembling and fainting with terror almost every day, afraid he would fall ill, would catch cold, do something naughty, climb on a chair and fall off it, and so on and so on. She had such terrible attacks of hysterics, lasting with intervals for several days, that Kolya, seriously alarmed at last, promised on his honor that such pranks should never be repeated. And all that day the mother and son were constantly rushing into each other's arms sobbing. It must be noted that Kolya understood and divined what was in Dardanelov's heart and, of course, despised him profoundly for his \"feelings\"; he had in the past been so tactless as to show this contempt before his mother, hinting vaguely that he knew what Dardanelov was after. But from the time of the railway incident his behavior in this respect also was changed; he did not allow himself the remotest allusion to the subject and began to speak more respectfully of Dardanelov before his mother, which the sensitive woman at once appreciated with boundless gratitude. Next day Kolya woke up as \"unfeeling\" as before, but he had become more silent, more modest, sterner, and more thoughtful. His mother still fretted and trembled, but the more uneasy she became, the greater were the hopes of Dardanelov. But of this later. The boys played together, and on the fourth or fifth day of Kolya's stay at the station, a mad bet was made by the foolish boys. Kolya, who was almost the youngest of the party and rather looked down upon by the others in consequence, was moved by vanity or by reckless bravado to bet them two roubles that he would lie down between the rails at night when the eleven o'clock train was due, and would lie there without moving while the train rolled over him at full speed.

she married a penniless, low-level soldier, as Lord Fermor recalls.\nKelso reportedly hired \"some Belgian brute\" to insult the husband and lure him into a duel, in which he was killed.\nLady Margaret was with child: Dorian.\nShe died within a year or so of the duel.\nKelso is dead and probably left his fortune to Dorian.\nThe mother had money of her own, so Dorian should be well off financially.\nAfter some casual conversation about the charming, deceptive nature of American girls, Lord Henry is off to his Aunt Agatha's for lunch.\nDorian also attends the luncheon, and Lord Henry dominates the conversation, delighting his audience at the table with a number of aphorisms -- for example, \"I can sympathize with everything except suffering.\"\nTo an aging duchess, he suggests, \"To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.\"\nLord Henry then launches into a triumphant monologue in praise of folly that echoes his speech to Dorian the day before in Basil's garden.\nAfter the luncheon, Lord Henry and Dorian leave together.", "Shortly after his first meeting with Dorian Gray, Lord Henry visits his uncle, Lord Fermor, a \"genial if somewhat rough-mannered\" old nobleman.\nWhen Lord Henry asks his uncle about Dorian Gray's past, the old man tells him that Dorian comes from an unhappy family with a dark, tangled history.\nHe relates that Dorian's mother, a noblewoman, eloped with a poor soldier; the woman's father, a villainous old lord, arranged to have his daughter's husband killed just before Dorian was born.\nThe grieving widow died soon thereafter, leaving Dorian to be raised by a loveless tyrant.\nWith this information, Lord Henry becomes increasingly fascinated with Dorian; he finds the story romantic and delights in the thought that he might influence the young man, making \"that wonderful spirit his own.\nShortly thereafter, Lord Henry goes to dine at the home of his aunt, Lady Agatha, where several of London's elite upper class--Dorian included--have gathered.\nLord Henry scandalizes the group by going on at length about the virtues of hedonism and selfishness and mocking his aunt's philanthropic efforts.\nI can sympathize with everything,\" he remarks at one point, \"except suffering.\nHe insists that one's life should be spent appreciating beauty and seeking out pleasure rather than searching for ways to alleviate pain and tragedy.\nMany of the guests are appalled by his selfishness, but he is so clever and witty that they are charmed in spite of themselves.\nDorian Gray is particularly fascinated, so much so that he leaves with Lord Henry and abandons his earlier plans to visit Basil"], "prediction": "\"Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world,\" said Lord Henry languidly.  \"I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End.

The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real:  how strange it all was!

His late benefactor, it is true, was a Scot--even to the length of being called Alexander McNeil--and Jim came from a long way south of the Tweed; but at the distance of six or seven thousand miles Great Britain, though never diminished, looks foreshortened enough even to its own children to rob such details of their importance.

He did, however, come in a crazy dug-out, sitting (very still and with his knees together, for fear of overturning the thing)--sitting on a tin box--which I had lent him--nursing on his lap a revolver of the Navy pattern--presented by me on parting--which, through an interposition of Providence, or through some wrong-headed notion, or else from sheer instinctive sagacity, he had decided to carry unloaded.'Upon every other point I was perfectly frank with him, and I even (as I believed at the time) exaggerated the danger of the undertaking. As a matter of fact I did not do it justice; his first day in Patusan was nearly his last--would have been his last if he had not been so reckless or so hard on himself and had condescended to load that revolver.

They, too, I should think, were in luck, and I was sure their pertinacity would be equal to it.'Jim, as I've told you, accompanied me on the first stage of my journey back to the world he had renounced, and the way at times seemed to lead through the very heart of untouched wilderness.

He has confided so much in me that at times it seems as though he must come in presently and tell the story in his own words, in his careless yet feeling voice, with his offhand manner, a little puzzled, a little bothered, a little hurt, but now and then by a word or a phrase giving one of these glimpses of his very own self that were never any good for purposes of orientation. I've looked in at a sentence here and there. He had tried to write; do you notice the commonplace hand? It is headed \"The Fort, Patusan.\" I suppose he had carried out his intention of making out of his house a place of defence.

Doramin had agreed to furnish him the guns; and so each man of his party would know there was a place of safety, upon which every faithful partisan could rally in case of some sudden danger. All this showed his judicious foresight, his faith in the future. You had said you knew so well \"that kind of thing,\" its illusory satisfaction, its unavoidable deception.

Brown was a latter-day buccaneer. He had done that kind of thing before--in the way of business, when he was in the Straits of Macassar.'It seems, however, that the headman of the fishing village at Batu Kring had managed to send off a timely warning. Brown's idea was to make for Madagascar, where he expected, on grounds not altogether illusory, to sell the schooner in Tamatave, and no questions asked, or perhaps obtain some more or less forged papers for her.'Brown's crowd transferred themselves without losing an instant, taking with them their firearms and a large supply of ammunition. They were sixteen in all: two runaway blue-jackets, a couple of simple, blond Scandinavians, one bland Chinaman who cooked--and the rest of the nondescript men of the South Seas. They were short food and water for a few days, and then they were ready to go. Brown expected an attack to be delivered as soon as the tide had flowed enough again to enable the war-boats which had cut off his retreat to enter the creek. At any rate he was sure there would be an attempt to carry off his long-boat, which lay below the hill, a dark high lump on the feeble sheen of a wet mud-flat.

some think it is power or fame or pleasure or bodily health and beauty, but they confuse the ends and the means.\nHumans are like drunkards unable to find their way home.\nWhat really produces happiness is \"a condition of self-sufficiency with no wants\".\nAll those things--pleasure, fame, wealth, and beauty--are fine in their place, but they do not bring self-sufficiency by themselves, nor happiness.\nYet Nature has set men on in their common pursuit of the good.\nPhilosophy sings a song about Providence keeping all creatures in motion to fulfill their destiny.\nA bird wants to fly, the sun wants to rise: \"All things seek the place that best becomes... and make itself a circle without end\"."], "prediction": ",, and all that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, \" by the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the nature of the way of the nature of the nature of the way of the nature of the nature of the way of the nature of the nature of the way of the nature of the way of the nature of the way of the nature of the way of the nature of the same and the nature of the nature of the nature of the soul of the world, and the nature of the nature of the power of the soul, and the nature of the nature of the power of the soul, and the nature of the nature of the power of the soul, and the nature of the nature of the power of the soul, and the nature of the nature of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the same and the way of the power of the power of the power of the same and the way of the way of the power of the power of the same of the same of the same of the same of the same of the same of the same of the same of the same of the same of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way of the way"}
{"references": ["Book IV examines the problem of evil's existence.\nBoethius has listened to and agreed with all of the arguments Philosophy has so far presented.\nBut if God is perfect in his goodness, and is the unity of all things rules the world, how is it that evil is allowed to exist and is not always punished?\nIn addition, where wickedness flourishes, virtue is often downtrodden and even stamped out.\nIf God is omniscient and omnipotent and beneficent how can this evil continue in His world?\nLady Philosophy reminds Boethius of his catechism - that God has said no evil will go unpunished, no virtue will be forgotten.\nPhilosophy also asserts that the wicked are weak and have no power, and the virtuous are strong and powerful.\nAll people strive to true happiness; the wicked cannot possibly attain it, and the virtuous can attain it.\nThe evil people of the world seek happiness in misguided ways, and they will never attain their goal.\nEvil people are excluded from attaining the supreme good of perfect happiness, and therefore they are excluded from all that really exists.\nSince they cannot possibly attain the only thing of value any earthly power they have is not actually power at all.\nEvil people, Philosophy says, cease to exist.\nThe wicked lose power and strength by striving for things that do not matter.\nThey also lose their humanity, and become like the animals they represent by their various desires.\nBoethius agrees, but he laments that the wicked harm the virtuous and are not punished.\nWickedness, like virtue, Philosophy assures Boethius, is its own reward.\nThe wicked, by the fact of their very wickedness, are rewarded by their lack of existence and their descent into bestiality.\nThe are, by their own actions rather than by any outside punishment, denied happiness.\nIf they are punished, the evil people of the world are given a good, for they have a chance at redeeming themselves and changing their ways.\nWhen the evil people of the world escape punishment, their capacity and likelihood for more wickedness increases.\nBoethius finds this difficult, and protests.\nHe can't abide that the good must suffer the earthly punishments that the evil, who deserve them, inflict upon them.\nThis is acceptable in a world where nothing is determinate, but our world, he says, is ruled by God.\nHow can God in his omnipotence", "of Parts I and II Since the existence of evil was the stumbling block for Boethius at the end of the last book, it is examined more closely now.\nBoethius comments that he likes the sweet songs of Philosophy, but he has not yet forgotten his sorrow.\nHe challenges her that even though good ultimately rules the world, evil still exists and goes unpunished.\nWhat is worse, when wickedness is in charge, it not only does not reward the good, it actively punishes the good.\nIt is a mystery how this can happen in a world ruled by an omnipotent God.\nPhilosophy corrects his ideas, saying that the good are always strong, and the wicked always weak.\nSin is always punished and virtue always rewarded.\nShe tells him she will show him the path to bring him home, and she will give his mind wings.\nThen she recites a poem about the ascent of the soul to God where the soul says, \"I remember\".\nBoethius says he is anxious for her to keep her promise to give his mind wings.\nAll human activity depends on will and power, she says.\nThe instinctive direction of the human will is towards happiness, which is the same as the good.\nBoth good men and bad men strive for the same thing--the good.\nThe good men become good because they are already by nature virtuous.\nIf the bad men obtain the good, they are no longer bad.\nThe power of good men is therefore stronger in the pursuit of good, and the bad are weaker and have to put forth more effort.\nBecause they do not know how to gain the good, the bad are ignorant and weak through lack of self-control.\nIf the ignorant turn to vice on purpose, they not only cease to be powerful, they cease to exist at all, because existence and life derive from the good.\nWhatever \"power\" the evil have, therefore, comes from weakness, not strength.\nSince God has the supreme power, and that supreme power is goodness, evil cannot be counted as a form of power.\nThe wise achieve their desire, while the wicked only get pleasure without the good."],

Such an innovation would bring down upon the head of the imprudent builder an eternal reputation for _wrongheadedness_, and he will be lost for ever in the sight of those wise, well-balanced people who dispense public esteem in Franche-Comte.As a matter of fact, these prudent people exercise in the place the most offensive despotism.

A saw can be seen going up and down at a height of eight to ten feet in the middle of the shed, while a piece of wood is propelled against this saw by a very simple mechanism. It is a wheel whose motive-power is supplied by the stream, which sets in motion this double piece of mechanism, the mechanism which gently pushes the piece of wood towards the saw, which cuts it up in the middle of the shed. It is doubtful if any face out of all the innumerable varieties of the human physiognomy was ever distinguished by a more arresting individuality. The big black eyes which betokened in their tranquil moments a temperament at once fiery and reflective were at the present moment animated by an expression of the most ferocious hate. The butt of the whole house, he hated his brothers and his father.

He was very dissatisfied with Julien, and it was for Julien that M. de Renal offered the undreamt-of salary of 300 fcs. a year, with board and even clothing. This latter claim, which Father Sorel had had the genius to spring upon the mayor, had been granted with equal suddenness by M. de Renal. He wanted, he said, to consult his son, as if in the provinces, forsooth, a rich father consulted a penniless son for any other reason than as a mere matter of form. It was the young man's concentration on his book, rather than the din made by the saw, which prevented him from hearing his father's terrible voice.\"So that's it, is it, lazy bones! always going to read your damned books are you, when you're keeping watch on the saw?

For many years past Julien had scarcely passed a single year of his life without reminding himself that Buonaparte, the obscure and penniless lieutenant, had made himself master of the whole world by the power of his sword. This idea consoled him for his misfortune, which he considered to be great, and rendered such joyful moments as he had doubly intense. He would then dream with gusto of being presented one day to the pretty women of Paris. He would manage to attract their attention by some dazzling feat: why should he not be loved by one of them just as Buonaparte, when still poor, had been loved by the brilliant Madame de Beauharnais. He was then silent for a moment. It had occurred to M. de Renal that he would have to tell his wife the figure which he had cut throughout these negotiations. \"But I shall never get anything out of you, you damned hypocrite,\" he went on. \"As a matter of fact, I am going to get rid of you, and my saw-mill will go all the better for it.

He did not look at Madame de Renal on a single occasion without that look having a reason, but nevertheless he was not sufficiently stupid to fail to see that he was not succeeding at all in being amiable, and was succeeding even less in being fascinating. He had only one sensible idea. He made himself a very minute plan of campaign, moulded on the confidences of Fouque, and a little that he had read about love in the Bible. As he was very nervous, though he did not admit it to himself, he wrote down this plan. He told M. de Renal that he was going to Verrieres to see the cure.At Verrieres Julien found M. Chelan occupied in moving. This circumstance had not been anticipated in his plan.

But on that day also he was rather sulky. His rakish pose weighed him down so terribly that if he could have followed his own inclination he would have returned to his room for several days and refrained from seeing the ladies any more. In a word, the very quality which made Julien into a superior being was precisely that which prevented him from savouring the happiness which was placed within his grasp.\"My God! being happy--being loved, is that all it comes to?\" This was Julien's first thought as he entered his room. \"Have I failed in nothing which I owe to myself?

He was looking at those jewels and those dresses which had had been her wedding presents. He could not sate himself with the pleasure of smelling their perfume. \"It is impossible,\" he said to himself \"for there to be anything more beautiful in Paris.\" He could find no flaw in his happiness. In the surprise caused by so singular a mark of love, he regarded her with passion, for he had thought her very pretty over breakfast, and while keeping his eyes downcast he had passed his time in thinking of the details of her charms. In a moment of abandon, he even confessed to her all his nervousness. He would have liked to have been able to consult her on the strange temptation which Fouque's offer held out to him, but a little episode rendered any frankness impossible. His love leaned on him and looked at him. \"What a fiery soul! What a delightful life one would have with him?\"As for Julien, he had never been so near to those terrible instruments of feminine artillery. His mistress's rank seemed to lift him above himself. There were moments where, in spite of his habitual hypocrisy, he found an extreme delight in confessing to this great lady who admired him, his ignorance of a crowd of little usages. The sincere admiration and ecstacies of his mistress would frequently make him forget that silly pose which had rendered him so stiff and almost ridiculous during the first moments of the intrigue. In those moments when he forgot his ambition, Julien admired ecstatically even the hats and even the dresses of Madame de Renal. His acts of devotion, and his ecstacies at the sight of his mistress's charms finished by reassuring her a little with regard to the difference of age. \"And I have no lucky rival after all,\" said Madame de Renal to herself with delight.

The latter immediately began to examine his trunk, at the bottom of which the fatal cards had been so carefully hidden. He realised that it was necessary to have them incessantly before his eyes. He had not spoken to him on a single occasion apart from the confessional, and even there he listened more than he spoke. But the fact which he did not know, and which they refrained from telling him, was that coming out first in the different courses of dogma, ecclesiastical history, etc., etc., which are taken at the seminary, constituted in their eyes, neither more nor less than a splendid sin. His comrades saw in this a most odious trait, and the most foolish hypocrisy. \"At last,\" said the writer to Julien, \"Heaven has granted me the grace of hating, not the author of my fall, but my fall itself.

But as they were returning from the Bois de Boulogne he fell right in the middle of the Rue du Bac, as he suddenly tried to get out of the way of a cabriolet, and was spattered all over with mud. It was lucky that he had two suits. The marquis, wishing to favour him with a few words at dinner, asked him for news of his excursion.\"M. le Comte,\" said Julien, \"if it were a question of felling an eighty-foot tree or hewing it out and making it into planks I would acquit myself all right, I daresay, but as for riding a horse, I haven't done such a thing six times in my life.\" fixme\"Well, this will be the seventh,\" said Norbert. \"Think of a provincial being simple over a matter like that.

But it must be said in praise of this class of men, such as they are found to-day in the salons of the aristocracy, that every one did not find them equally tame. There was rarely any overt lack of consideration, but Julien had already caught at meals two or three little short dialogues between the marquis and his wife which were cruel to those who were seated near them. He saw nothing in these young peoples' conversation except a vein of universal scandal-mongering and was shocked by it. \"So,\" thought Julien as he heard them laugh on the staircase, \"I have just come from the Hotel de la Mole where I learnt that Russia, etc.\" petertoddJulien learnt from one of the toadies that scarcely six months ago madame de la Mole had rewarded more than twenty years of assiduous attention by promoting the poor baron Le Bourguignon, who had been a sub-prefect since the restoration, to the rank of prefect. The good fellow was still pale from this great business. He was the only son of that celebrated Jew who was famous for the riches that he had won by lending money to kings to make war on the peoples. In politics, however, he was a brazen cynic. The young people who came to pay their calls were frightened of speaking of anything which might make them suspected of thinking or of betraying that they had read something prohibited, and they were afraid to say a word to the marquis de la Mole, who was a man of great influence, to whom they were not accustomed to speak.

The two gentlemen alluded to some spicy anecdotes of which Julien and his second, the lieutenant of the 96th, were absolutely ignorant. The man went away, though not without turning round from time to time to shake his fist and hurl insults at him. \"So,\" he said angrily to himself, \"the meanest of mankind has it in his power to affect me as much as this. How am I to kill so humiliating a sensitiveness?\"SourceFileWhere was he to find a second? He did not have a single friend. He had several acquaintances, but they all regularly left him after six weeks of social intercourse. It was only when he was being ushered in, that Julien thought that it might quite well be the young relation of Madame de Renal, who had once been employed at the Rome or Naples Embassy, and who had given the singer Geronimo a letter of introduction.He and his second were kept waiting for a good three-quarters of an hour. When Julien gave the name of M. de la Mole's hotel, the young diplomat and his friend exchanged looks. \"That is awful,\" said one, \"that is the only place one does go to. You must rid yourself of them. But I have one favour to ask of you, which will only cost you a bare half-hour of your time. Go and watch every opera day at half-past eleven all the people in society coming out in the vestibule. Your first visit must be when they are playing the '_Comte Ory_.'\" The young diplomatist was very pleased with the idea, and he went with his friend to the theatre, where he saw the famous singer Geronimo, and he was astonished to see that the young man was remarkably straight. The only extraordinary feature was the diplomatist in a dressing-gown.

He tried to study for a moment the people who were endeavouring to overwhelm him with their contempt. He noticed that comte Norbert did not even deign to look at him when he met him about the house. As Julien scrutinized M. de Croisenois with a stern gaze of unhappiness, he observed that this good amiable young man attributed a great influence to occult causes. \"He must be doing something very much against the grain,\" he thought; \"he is naturally so polite.\" He did not know what to do. He was compelled to fall back on his memory, which was, it must be said, a very good memory. The question was, how he could leave the little straw chair without undue awkwardness. In spite of his physical fatigue, memories which were only too seductive commenced to invade his imagination. He wanted to invent something, and tried to extract some novel excuse from an imagination which was otherwise engrossed. His misery was so great that he could not bear to think of anything else.The poor Julien found himself subjected to the energy of a superior intellect, which was animated against him by the most violent hate. In these cases the very transports of fury constitute a vivid pleasure.

He was beginning to acquit himself with some credit in that sentimental picturesque jargon which is called wit in certain salons. The first of the 53 letters with which Prince Korasoff had presented him commenced with a tirade on this sentiment. He had been waiting to hear from Julien for a long time, but he had not been able to get a word out of him, and he had been waiting to hear from Julien for a long time. This evening was exactly what he had predicted. The marquis de la Mole had the same pretensions for his father as Julien had for his father, and he had been waiting to hear from Julien for a long time, and he had been waiting to hear from Julien for a long time.He would have approved the line of conduct which Julien followed on the subsequent days. If, however, she likes to do harm, it is because she is unhappy, I suspect some secret misfortune.As madame de la Mole's views were invariably a counterpart of the opinions of that husband of hers who could make her into a Duchess, she had been singing Julien's praises for some days. \"As a matter of fact he is my husband,\" she said to herself. \"If I am sincere in my return to sensible notions, he is clearly the man I ought to marry.\"She was expecting importunities and airs of unhappiness on the part of Julien; she commenced rehearsing her answers to her when they"}

He got there in advance, but was careful to turn his chair in such a way as not to see Mathilde. By looking under the brim of his hat in a certain way, he could get a view of Mathilde's figure without seeing her eyes. \"Consequently,\" he said to himself, \"she cannot see mine, and that is not really looking at her.\"In the evening madame de Fervaques behaved towards him, exactly as though she had never received the philosophic mystical and religious dissertation which he had given to her porter in the morning with so melancholy an air. She, on her side, left the blue sofa a minute after the marechale's arrival; this involved abandoning her usual associates. But the step of that horse, which she knew so well, and Julien's way of knocking on the stable door with his riding-whip to call a man, sometimes attracted Mathilde to behind the window-curtain. M. de Croisenois seemed overwhelmed by this new caprice: his palpable grief alleviated the awfulness of Julien's agony.This unexpected turn in his life made him talk like an angel, and inasmuch as a certain element of self-appreciation will insinuate itself even into those hearts which serve as a temple for the most august virtue, the marechale said to herself as she got into her carriage, \"Madame de la Mole is right, this young priest has distinction. I shall be treated with the utmost contempt, and nothing will amuse me more. Yes, it will amuse me to load with ridicule that odious creature whom I call myself.\"Nevertheless how many conversions have begun like that! What makes me consider this a good omen is the difference between his style and that of the young people whose letters I have had an opportunity of seeing. This young man must have managed to appreciate the difference; he writes well, but I fear very much that this request of his in his letter for me to enlighten him with my advice, is really nothing less than an, as yet, unconscious sentiment.

He soon appreciated that to avoid appearing vulgar in the eyes of the marechale it was necessary to eschew simple and rational ideas. He would continue on these lines, or would cut short his grand eloquence according as he saw appreciation or indifference in the eyes of the two great ladies whom he had set out to please.\"It's like the small talk in a bad book,\" thought Julien. \"All the greatest subjects of human thought are proudly tackled. After listening for three minutes one asks oneself which is greater--the speaker's bombast, or his abominable ignorance?\" fixmeIt was only then that he remembered madame de Fervaque's letters which he had forgotten to give back to the grave Spaniard Don Diego Bustos. They were really almost as nonsensical as those of the young Russian nobleman. There was a sectarian jealousy between the austere Jansenist and the salon of the virtuous marechale which was Jesuitical, reactionary, and monarchical. \"What a moral century!\" he thought. \"I am the only one in the world who is not in love with the pretty lady, and I am the only one in the world who is not in love with her.

He did not say a single word to the marechale which was not a lie, or at any rate, an abominable travesty of his own way of thinking, which Mathilde knew so perfectly in every phase. This Machiavellianism impressed her. \"What subtlety,\" she said to herself. \"What a difference between the bombastic coxcombs, or the common rascals like Tanbeau who talk in the same strain.\"Nevertheless Julien went through awful days. It was only to accomplish the most painful of duties that he put in a particularly appearance in the marechale's salon. The reader doubtless shares all the ennui of the colourless life which Julien was leading. But on the following day a glimpse of Mathilde's arm between the sleeve of her dress and her glove sufficed to plunge our young philosopher into memories which, though agonising, none the less gave him a hold on life. \"Well,\" he said to himself, \"I will follow this Russian plan to the end. This period represents the steppes of our journey. I was then either going to make my fortune or come to grief just as I am now. The following spring, just eleven short months later, I was perhaps the happiest of all young people of my own age.\"But very often all this fine logic proved unavailing against the awful reality. When he thought he had noticed that mademoiselle de la Mole was beginning to encourage her intended, Julien could not help looking tenderly at his pistols as he went up to his room.

It was a case of the triumph of the triumph of ennui, of Julien's letters, which had been written by mademoiselle de la Mole.One day, madame de Fervaques, after having asked three times if there were any letters for her, suddenly decided to answer Julien. She entered the library as the porter was leaving it, the letter was still on the edge of the table. \"What a pity that M. Sorel was not a real priest! He could then be admitted to a kind of intimacy; but in view of that cross, and that almost lay dress, one is exposed to cruel questions and what is one to answer?\" She did not finish the train of thought, \"Some malicious woman friend may think, and even spread it about that he is some lower middle-class cousin or other, a relative of my father, some tradesman who has been decorated by the National Guard.\" Up to the time which she had seen Julien, madame de Fervaque's greatest pleasure had been writing the word marechale after her name. The boredom of a mode of life whose ambitions were concentrated on impressing the public without her having at heart any real faculty of enjoyment for that kind of success, had become so intolerable since she had begun to think of Julien that, all that was necessary to prevent her chambermaids being bullied for a whole day, was that their mistress should have passed an hour in the society of this strange young man on the evening of the preceding day. Her old porter noticed that whenever he brought a letter from this handsome young man, who always looked so sad, he was certain to see that absent, discontented expression, which the marechale always made a point of assuming on the entry of any of her servants, immediately disappear. \"Here I am appointed lover and valet in one,\" thought Julien, and he bowed, amused himself by wrinkling his face up like Arsene, the old valet of the marquis. \"It would be so easy for me,\" said the marechale, \"to make him a grand vicar in some diocese near Paris! but plain M.

Mathilde would be bound to know of his presence or his discourteous absence. In spite of the clearness of this logic, he could not at the beginning of the evening bring himself to plunge into society. Luckily he found the marechale's box packed with women, and was relegated to a place near the door where he was completely hidden by the hats. This position saved him from looking ridiculous; Caroline's divine notes of despair in the _Matonio Segreto_ made him burst into tears. He took away his hands which Mathilde was pressing in her own, and moved a little away from her with a marked respect. He then busied himself with putting together madame de Fervaque's letters which were spread out on the divan, and it was with all the appearance of extreme politeness that he cruelly exploited the psychological moment by adding, \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\"Mademoiselle de la Mole will allow me to reflect over all this.\" He went rapidly away and left the library; she heard him shut all the doors one after the other.

Valenod, the mayor's assistant, has erupted on the otherwise peaceful existence of the village.\nThe village, a microcosm of Paris and of all of France in this respect, is politically divided into two camps: royalists like the mayor and a liberal element dissatisfied with the Restoration.\nThey are in agreement, however, upon the importance that they attribute to money and in their slavish respect for small-town public opinion.\nFather Chelan, Jansenist and village priest for many years, takes M. Appert on a tour of the workhouse and prison, thereby disobeying the wishes of M. Valenod, who risks being exposed for misuse of funds, given the pitiable conditions existing in these institutions.\nRenal and Valenod have, in fact, visited Chelan and reprimanded him for this action.\nThis is the subject of the conversation between M. and Mme. de Renal one day as they are strolling with their three children on the \"Cours de La Fidelite,\" a public promenade sustained by an enormous retaining wall, the glory of Verrieres, the construction of which is due to the administration of Mayor de Renal.\nThe latter then proposes to his wife that they hire Julien Sorel, student priest of Chelan, as tutor for their children, a move destined to increase his own social prestige since it will cause envy among the liberal textile mill owners.\nJulien's father, a crafty sawyer, has already, in the past, outwitted Renal in a land transaction."], "prediction": "ThisThis, and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on and so on.

Antipholus can turn from loving his wife to being so unfaithful.\nShe says Antipholus may have married her sister for money, but she wishes he'd be better to her for the money's sake, then.\nLuciana doesn't tell him to be faithful, exactly.\nInstead, she recommends that if he does love another, that he do it stealthily, as it's one offense to cheat on your wife, and an entirely different offense to let the poor woman know about it.\nAccording to Luciana, a man should hide his infidelity for his wife's sake.\nLuciana finally deflects S. Antipholus by saying women are gullible, and will believe what men want them to believe, especially if the men can flatter them by claiming true love.\nS. Antipholus is undeterred.\nAgain, he wonders how Luciana even knows his name.\nHe admits he doesn't really know her name, and decides that she must be some divine creature.\nHe pleads with her to be his mentor, and teach him the ways of the world and himself.\nFinally, S. Antipholus rightly asserts that he has no wife, and either way, he prefers Luciana to Adriana.\nBesides, Adriana is inside the house crying as they speak.\nS. Antipholus wishes Luciana would do more with her power than just try to get him to love her sister.\nHe basically declares Luciana to be the apple of his eye.\nLuciana is weirded out and runs off to try to comfort her sister.\nJust then, S. Dromio runs in, out of breath.\nS. Dromio says this woman, the unattractive kitchen wench, claims that he's her man.\nThough the girl's not appealing, she did know Dromio by name.\nEven creepier, she knew about"], "prediction": "_] _drudge of the Devil,                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        150 'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack, and be gone.

{"references": ["At the marketplace in Ephesus, Angelo the goldsmith talks with a merchant.\nApparently, Angelo owes him some money, and the Merchant wants to collect it before he sets sail to Persia.\nAngelo expects to pay off the Merchant with the money he'll get from E. Antipholus, who he thinks owes him for Adriana's necklace...which he would, if Angelo hadn't just given the necklace to S. Antipholus.\nJust then, E. Antipholus and E. Dromio enter the scene, having just left the Porpentine.\nE. Antipholus has arrived, expecting to collect the necklace from Angelo, but he's in for a surprise.\nE. Antipholus sends E. Dromio off to buy some rope and then chides Angelo for not showing up at the Porpentine with the necklace.\nA squabble ensues, where it becomes clear that neither man has the necklace.\nAngelo insists he gave it to Antipholus not half an hour ago, but E. Antipholus insists he got no such thing.\nAre you following this?\nPayment for the chain is increasingly important, as the Merchant is halting his sails until Angelo pays him, though Angelo needs to get the money from Antipholus first.\nUltimately, the Merchant calls for E. Antipholus to be arrested.\nThough Angelo regrets it, as he isn't getting paid, he corroborates with the Merchant to get E. Antipholus jailed.\nJustifiably, E. Antipholus is angry and confused.\nTo add to the confusion, S. Dromio arrives, mistakes E. Antipholus for his master, and informs him that he's secured the ship to get out of Ephesus.\nE. Antipholus curses S. Dromio for talking nonsense, and then gives him instructions to go to Adriana and get money for his bail.\nAs the jailer runs off with E. Antipholus, S. Dromio is left to wonder why he's instructed to go back to the awful place where they had dinner.\nStill, he follows E. Antipholus's instructions, because he knows his place as a servant."], "prediction":

he reveals to Miranda that Antonio is his brother, and that he was once the rightful Duke of Milan, a position Antonio now holds.\nAntonio usurped Prospero's estate and wealth while Prospero became increasingly \"rapt in secret studies\" and oblivious to his brother's machinations; and in order to take Prospero's title as well, Antonio arranged to have his brother Prospero and Prospero's daughter Miranda killed secretly.\nBut Prospero is widely known to be a good man, so those charged with his death decide not to kill him, Instead, Prospero and Miranda were set adrift on the open sea in a decayed vessel, and were able to survive off the supplies that the honest councilor Gonzalo arranged for them to have; thus, they landed on the island where they now live.\nAfter Prospero's tale, Ariel, a magical spirit, appears; it becomes clear that she is in Prospero's service, and caused the storm, at Prospero's bidding.\nKing Alonso and company are now \"dispersed'bout the isle,\" and Ariel has made the incident look like a shipwreck.\nAriel also expresses her wish to be freed by Prospero, although he rescued her from the nasty witch Sycorax.\nCaliban, who was Syncorax's son, also makes an appearance;
