Well, you guessed it: compassion isn't really conducive to the sort of warlike ruler Machiavelli advocates and might actually destroy a nation.\nJust like it's better to be a little mean than nice for the sake of the nation, it's better to be feared than loved because people seem to react better to punishment than love.\nAgain, Machiavelli keeps telling us not to become hated, which is easy enough if you lay off people's families and lands.\nIn Machiavelli's example section, he tells us how Hannibal was super awesome because he was insanely cruel.\nWe mean, there's a reason why that scary dude from Silence of the Lambs was named Hannibal.\nGuess who almost wasn't awesome?\nThis guy called Scipio who was all mushy touchy feely and didn't want to punish people.\nLucky for him, other people covered up his namby-pamby nature.\nBut everyone is not so lucky.\nAnyway, in the end, since the people choose if they like you or not, don't worry about it.\nJust make sure that they don't hate you.", "Every prince will want to be considered merciful, but mercy should not be mismanaged.\nCesare Borgia, by being cruel, restored peace and order to the Romagna.\nNo prince should mind being called cruel for keeping his subjects peaceful and loyal.\nPunishing a few, and thus averting disorder, is better than allowing troubles to develop that will hurt many.\nNew rulers cannot avoid seeming cruel, because their states are insecure.\nStill, a prince should not be too rash or too fearful.\nIf you cannot be both loved and feared, then it is better to be feared than loved.\nMen are generally fickle, afraid of danger, and greedy.\nWhen a prince benefits them, they will do anything for the prince, but when trouble comes, they will desert the prince.\nPeople will break ties of love if it is to their advantage, but fear of punishment they will never transgress.\nA prince must be careful not to make himself hated, even though he is feared; to do this, he must keep his hands off his subjects' property and their women.\nPeople will sooner forget the death of a father than the loss of an inheritance.\nHowever, when a prince commands an army, he must be cruel in order to control his troops.\nIn conclusion, people love at their own wish, but fear at the prince's will, so a wise ruler will rely on what he can best control.", "Concerning Cruelty: Whether It Is Better to Be Loved Than to Be Feared, or the Reverse  Compassion, like generosity, is usually admired.\nBut a prince must be careful that he does not show compassion unwisely.\nIf a prince is too compassionate, and does not adequately punish disloyal subjects, he creates an atmosphere of disorder, since his subjects take the liberty to do what they please--even to the extremes of murder and theft.\nCrime harms the entire community, whereas executions harm only the individuals who commit crimes.\nSome measure of cruelty is necessary to maintain order.\nBut a prince should be careful in his exercise of cruelty, tempering it with humanity and prudence.\nMachiavelli then asks whether being feared or loved is preferable.\nIdeally, a prince should be both loved and feared, but this state of affairs is difficult to attain.\nForced to make a choice, it is much better to be feared than loved.\nThis is because men, by nature, are \"ungrateful, fickle, dissembling, anxious to flee danger, and covetous of gain.\nIn times of remote danger, they are willing to take risks for their prince, but if the danger is real, they turn against their prince.\nIt is easy to break a bond of love when the situation arises, but the fear of punishment is always effective, regardless of the situation.\nWhen inducing fear, however, a prince must be careful to avoid inducing hatred.\nHe must make sure that any executions are properly justified.\nAbove all, a prince should never confiscate the property of his subjects or take their women, since these actions are most likely to breed hatred.\nIf a prince must confiscate property, he must make sure he has a convincing reason.\nWith one's army, however, there is no such thing as too much cruelty.\nKeeping an army disciplined and united requires cruelty, even inhuman cruelty."], "prediction": " it is said that every prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel.Coming now to the other qualities mentioned above, \n i say that every prince ought to inspire fear in such a way that, if he does not win love, he avoids hatred; because he can endure very well being feared whilst he is not hated, which will always be as long as he abstains from the property of his citizens and subjects and from their women. but when it is necessary for him to proceed against the life of someone, he must do it on proper justification and for manifest cause, but above all things he must keep his hands off the property of others.    \n [ theore]*theorem * [ theore]remark [ theore]proposition [ theore]lemma [ theore]corollary [ theore]definition [ theore]example "}

Okay, okay.\nSome critics in the back of the room are pointing out that the Roman emperors followed this advice and still failed.\nFirst of all, that's like comparing apples to oranges.\nThey needed to deal with the greed and cruelty of the army in addition to not being hated.\nThis was a tough task, because the people wanted a peaceful leader, but the soldiers wanted the craziest, most bloodthirsty guy they could find.\nSince it was kind of impossible to please both sides, it was most important to", "A prince must avoid becoming hated or despised.\nTaking the property or the women of his subjects will make him hated.\nBeing frivolous, indecisive, and effeminate will make him despised.\nAll a prince's actions should show seriousness, strength, and decisiveness.\nThe best defense against internal threats such as conspiracy is to be neither hated nor despised.\nIf a conspirator thinks that killing the prince will enrage the people, he will think twice.\nWise princes are careful not to antagonize the nobles and to keep the people happy.\nIn France, the parliament restrains the ambition of the nobles and favors the people, without directly involving the king, so that he cannot be accused of favoritism.\nPrinces should let others do the unpleasant tasks, doing for themselves what will make them look good.\nSome people may object that the careers of the Roman emperors go against this argument, because many of them were greatly admired, yet were still assassinated.\nThis is because they had to deal with their soldiers, and they could not satisfy both the soldiers, who wanted warlike leaders, and the people, who wanted peace.\nMarcus, Pertinax, and Alexander were all compassionate and just, but only Marcus escaped assassination, because he was a hereditary ruler and did not owe his power to the army.\nCommodus, Severus, Antoninus, and Maximinus were all cruel and greedy, and only Severus escaped assassination, because he was so cunning and ruthless, and because he kept up a splendid reputation.\nBut in Machiavelli's time, princes do not have the same need to satisfy their armies, because armies are not used to being together for long periods and controlling whole provinces, the way Roman armies were.\nInstead, princes should satisfy the people, who are more powerful.", "The Need to Avoid Contempt and Hatred\nA prince must avoid being hated and despised at all costs.\nA prince may be criticized for a lack of virtue, but he will never be hated for it.\nHowever, a prince will be hated if he takes the property or women of his subjects.\nA prince must also avoid robbing his subjects of their honor.\nA prince will be despised if he has a reputation for being fickle, frivolous, effeminate, cowardly, or irresolute.\nIf a prince is regarded highly by his subjects, he will be shielded from conspiracies and open attacks.\nA prince should worry about two things: internal insurrection from his subjects and external threats from foreign powers.\nDefending against foreign enemies requires a strong army and good allies.\nA strong army always leads to good allies.\nA prince can defend against internal insurrection by making sure he is not hated or scorned by the people.\nThis is a powerful defense against conspiracies.\nA conspirator will have the courage to proceed with his conspiracy only if he believes the people will be satisfied when he kills the ruler.\nBut if the people would be outraged by the ruler's death, the conspirators will never have the gall to carry out the conspiracy.\nBy default, conspiracies are at a disadvantage.\nThey require the support of many people, each of whom faces severe punishment if the conspiracy is discovered.\nFurthermore, each of these people can profit richly by informing the prince about the conspiracy.\nA prince has on his side the entire government, his allies and the laws of the state.\nIf he secures the goodwill of the people, he seems invulnerable in the eyes of conspirators.\nWhenever possible, a prince should delegate the administration of unpopular laws to others and keep in his own power the distribution of favors.\nSometimes it will not be possible to avoid being hated by some members of the populace.\nIf it is not possible for the prince to avoid being hated, he must make it his first priority to escape the hatred of the most powerful parties.\nIn many instances, this will mean ensuring good standing within the ranks of the military.\nBut a prince should not worry too much about satisfying the demands of the troops, especially if it comes at the expense of the people.\nA number of later Roman emperors were overthrown due to excessive cruelty performed for the sake of their army.\nThe exception was Septimius Severus, who, emulating both"], "prediction": " it is said that a prince ought to reckon conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem ;

because he is in their debt.\nImmediately after taking power, the prince is in danger of losing his newly gained principality.\nWhen a prince successfully suppresses a revolt, however, the ruler can easily prevent further revolt by harshly punishing the rebels and decimating his opposition.\nThe ruler can deal more harshly with his subjects in response to the revolt than he would be able to normally.\nIt is much easier to maintain control over a new principality if the people share the same language and customs as the prince's own country.\nIf this is the case, the prince has to do only two things: destroy the family of the former prince, and maintain the principality's laws and taxes.\nPeople will live quietly and peacefully so long as their old ways of life are undisturbed.\nNew

Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on the revolt of others. but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, there is nothing to fear but the family of this prince, and, this being exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no credit with the people. and as the conqueror did not rely on them before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it. \n the examples of these two governments in our time are the Turk and the King of France. \n the causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom of the Turk are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the revolt of those whom the lord has around him. hence, he who attacks"}

They wished to hold Greece as the Spartans held it, making it free and permitting its laws, and did not succeed. So to hold it they were compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. But in republics there is more vitality, greater hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest way is to destroy them or to reside there. and he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it has always the watchword of liberty and its ancient privileges as a rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it to forget."}

great energy became a military commander in Syracuse.\nIn order to become ruler, he called the Senate and the leading citizens together for a meeting, and then massacred them.\nHis ability made him a

\"treacherous, pitiless, and irreligious.\nPrinces who commit criminal acts can achieve power, but never glory.\nKing Agathocles of Syracuse is an example of a man who rose to power through crime.\nAgathocles was a common citizen who joined the militia, rose to a leading rank in the army, and then assembled a meeting of the senate at which he ordered his men to kill all the senators and

applied once at the outset, and thereafter only employed in self-defense and for the greater good of one's subjects.\nRegular and frequent perpetration of cruel actions earns a ruler infamy.\nIf a prince comes to power by crime and wishes to be successful, he, like Agathocles, must only use cruelty in the first sense.\nTherefore, when a prince decides to seize a state, he must determine how much injury to inflict.\nHe needs to strike all at once and then refrain from further atrocities.\nIn this way, his subjects will eventually forget the violence and cruelty.\nGradually, resentment will fade, and the people will come to appreciate the resulting benefits of the prince's rule.\nMost important, a prince should be consistent in the way he treats his subjects"], "prediction": " a

first method, it will be illustrated by two examples--one ancient, the other modern--and without entering further into the subject, i consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to follow them.Agathocles, the Sicilian,(*) became King of Syracuse not only from a private but from a low and abject position. \n his barbarous cruelty and inhumanity with infinite

2) jump off a cliff to prove that you're the Son of God, and people will believe you; and 3) set yourself up as the ruler of the entire earth and use your power to compel people to obey you.\nAccording to Ivan's Grand Inquisitor, Christ rejected all of these temptations because he wanted man to freely follow him.\nBut the Grand Inquisitor claims Christ got it all wrong, because man does not want to be free.\nOr rather, only a chosen few can endure the terrible gift of freedom; the majority prefer to be led around, told what to do, and essentially be treated like children.\nSome even choose to accept the gift of freedom, but because they are not strong", "During the sixteenth century in Spain, at the height of the Inquisition, someone resembling Christ appears unannounced in the streets.\nThe people recognize Him immediately and begin to flock about Him.\nBut, as He is healing several of the sick and lame, an old cardinal also recognizes Him and orders the guards to arrest Him.\nOnce again Christ is abducted.\nThat night, He receives a visitor.\nThe Grand Inquisitor enters the darkened cell and begins a severe reprimand of Christ for appearing again and hindering the work of the church.\nThe Grand Inquisitor explains to Christ that, because of His rejection of the three temptations, He placed an intolerable burden of freedom upon man.\nThe church, however, is now correcting His errors and aiding man by removing their awful burden of freedom.\nHe explains that Christ erred when He expected man to voluntarily choose to follow Him.\nThe basic nature of man, says the Inquisitor, does not allow him to reject either earthly bread or security or happiness in exchange for something so indefinite as what Christ expects.\nIf Christ had accepted the proffered bread, man would have been given security instead of a freedom of choice, and if Christ had performed a miracle and had cast himself down from the pinnacle, man would have been given something miraculous to worship.\nThe nature of man, insists the Inquisitor, is to seek the miraculous.\nFinally, Christ should have accepted the power offered Him by the devil.\nBecause He did not, the church has now had to assume such power for the benefit of man.\nAnd since Christ's death, the church has been forced to correct the errors made by Him.\nNow, at last mankind willingly submits its freedom to the church in exchange for happiness and security.\nThis balance, says the Inquisitor, must not be upset.\nAt the end of the monologue, the Grand Inquisitor admits that of necessity he is on the side of the devil, but the challenge that Christ placed on mankind allows only a few strong people to be saved; the rest must be sacrificed to the strong.\nThe Grand Inquisitor's scheme, at least, provides an earthly happiness for the mass of mankind even though it will not lead to eternal salvation.\nOn the other hand, Christ's method would not have saved these same weak and puny men either.\nWhen he finishes, the Grand Inquisitor looks at Christ, who has remained silent the entire time.\nNow He approaches the old churchman and kisses him on his dry, withered", "Ivan explains his prose poem, \"The Grand Inquisitor.\"\nIn a town in Spain, in the sixteenth century, Christ arrives, apparently reborn on Earth.\nAs he walks through the streets, the people gather about him, staring.\nHe begins to heal the sick, but his ministrations are interrupted by the arrival of a powerful cardinal who orders his guards to arrest Christ.\nLate that night, this cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor, visits Christ's cell and explains why he has taken him prisoner and why he cannot allow Christ to perform his works.\nThroughout the Grand Inquisitor's lecture, Christ listens silently.\nThe Grand Inquisitor tells Christ that he cannot allow him to do his work on Earth, because his work is at odds with the work of the Church.\nThe Inquisitor reminds Christ of the time, recorded in the Bible, when the Devil presented him with three temptations, each of which he rejected.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that by rejecting these three temptations, he guaranteed that human beings would have free will.\nFree will, he says, is a devastating, impossible burden for mankind.\nChrist gave humanity the freedom to choose whether or not to follow him, but almost no one is strong enough to be faithful, and those who are not will be damned forever.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that Christ should have given people no choice, and instead taken power and given people security instead of freedom.\nThat way, the same people who were too weak to follow Christ to begin with would still be damned, but at least they could have happiness and security on Earth, rather than the impossible burden of moral freedom.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that the Church has now undertaken to correct Christ's mistake.\nThe Church is taking away freedom of choice and replacing it with security.\nThus, the Grand Inquisitor must keep Christ in prison, because if Christ were allowed to go free, he might undermine the Church's work to lift the burden of free will from mankind.\nThe first temptation Christ rejected was bread.\nHungry after his forty days of fasting, Christ was confronted by Satan, who told him that if he were really the son of God, he could turn a stone to bread and satisfy his hunger.\nChrist refused, replying that man should not live by bread, but by the word of God.\nThe Grand Inquisitor says that most people are too weak to live by the word of God when they are hungry.\nChrist should have taken the bread and offered mankind freedom from hunger instead of"], "prediction": " in the first part of the poem the author is a young man of ninety who has been in the wilderness for three years fifteen centuries ago. \n he has returned to the city of his birth and has been living there ever since. in the second part of the poem \n the author is a young man of thirty and has been living in the city of his birth for three years fifteen centuries ago. \n he has returned to the city of his birth and has been living there ever since. \n he has been living in the city of his birth for three years fifteen centuries ago. \n he has been living in the city of his birth for three years fifteen centuries ago. \n he has been living in the city of his birth for three years fifteen centuries ago. \n he has been living in the city of his birth for three years fifteen centuries ago. \n he has been living in the city of his birth for three years fifteen centuries ago.

it was apparently his attempt to write back to England.\nThe second was a letter that Jim had received from his father.\nThe third and fourth are documents written by Marlow.\nThe first was a letter to the recipient and the other was Marlow's account of Jim's last days and his death.\nMarlow's letter to the recipient reminds him of the doubts he had about Jim.\nHe then tells of Jim's building a system of defense for the natives in Patusan shortly after Marlow's departure.\nHe dug a trench around an area of land and then fenced it.\nHe next placed cannons at the corners.\nJim called the enclosed area \"The Fort, Patusan,\" and it was known as a place where the natives could come for safety in times of danger.\nIn the letter from Jim's father, which he received just before he boarded the Patna, there is a description about what each person in the family is doing.\nSince Jim's father was a pastor, the letter also gives advice about faith and goodness and cautions Jim not to be tempted.\nHe warns his son not \"to do anything which you believe to be wrong.\"\nThere is also an unfinished letter from Jim which said \"The Fort, Patusan\" and \"I must now at once.\"\nThe letter is so abrupt that Marlow cannot make out what it means.\nMarlow's document that describes Jim's last days is based upon several stories that Marlow has heard about his friend.\nAs Marlow describes what happened on Patusan, there is a sadness to his tone.\nHe cannot believe that he will never again see Jim's face or hear his voice.\nJim's tragic demise is largely due to Gentleman Brown, an immoral and dangerous Australian.\nMarlow called on him in Bangkok, as he lay dying from asthma.\n", "Six and Thirty Seven.\nIn Chapter Thirty Six, Marlow tells the readers that he has finished his main narrative with these words and his listeners drifted off and only one of them was to hear 'the last word of the story'.\nThis 'last word' comes to his home two years later in a thick packet; it is addressed to him in Marlow's handwriting...\nThis man is described as drawing the heavy curtains and the readers are told his wandering days are over.\nFor him, there are 'no more horizons as boundless as hope'.\nThe sight of the packet brings back sounds and visions and 'the very savour of the past'...\nThere are three main enclosures in the packet.\nThere is an explanatory letter from Marlow ; a good many pages pinned together; and a loose sheet of greyish paper...\nMarlow's letter explains how this man is the only one to have shown an interest in Jim after he told him his story.\nHe also says this reader had said that 'giving your life up to them'  'was like selling your soul to a brute'.\nMarlow also explains that the greyish paper is written by Jim and shows he had made his house into a place of defence.\nOn this piece of paper, Jim has written that 'an awful thing has happened', but gives no further explanation...\nThe old letter, which Marlow has forwarded, was found preserved in Jim's writing case and is from his father.\nIt is full of news of people who have never had to grapple with fate as Jim has done.\nMarlow also says the story of Jim's last events are also included  and 'it is romantic beyond the wildest dreams of his boyhood'.\nWe are told that the most astounding part of this adventure is that it is true.\nMarlow explains that he has written it down as if he were an eyewitness; his information was fragmentary and has had to fit the pieces together.\nThis chapter ends with Marlow saying it is difficult to believe Jim 'will never come' and that he will not hear his voice again...\nMarlow's first-person account begins in Chapter Thirty Seven and says it all begins with a man called Brown  and his theft of a Spanish schooner.\nMuch later, Brown tells Marlow about Jim and fills in the gap.\nBrown refers to Jim as the'stuck-up"], "prediction": " the story of the last events of the famous Gentleman Brown is told in the few pages enclosed here.''''
